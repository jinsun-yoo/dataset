Hence, the basic NUM problem becomes a nonconvex optimization problem. Solving the nonconvex NUM distributively is a difficult problem. The current works utilize the standard dual-based algorithm for the convex NUM and find the criteria for the global optimal convergence of the algorithm. It turns out that the link capacity must higher than a certain value to achieve the global optimum.  We propose a new distributed algorithm that converges to the suboptimal solution of the nonconvex NUM for all of link capacity. We approximate the logarithm of the original problem to the convex problem which is solved efficiently by the standard dual-base distributed algorithm. After a sequence of approximations, the solutions converge to the KKT solution of the original problem. In many of our experiments, it also converges to the global optimal solution of the NUM. Moreover, we extend our work to solve the joint rate and power NUM problem with elastic and inelastic traffic in a wireless network. Our techniques can be applied to any log-concave utilities.",1,The Successive Approximation Approach for NUM Frameworks with Elastic  and Inelastic Traffic
"Present work proposes a theoretical statistical model of the downlink power consumption in cellular CDMA networks. The proposed model employs a simple but popular propagation model, which breaks down path losses into a distance dependent and a log-normal shadowing loss term. Based on the aforementioned path loss formalism, closed-form expressions for the first and the second moment of power consumption are obtained taking into account conditions placed by cell selection and handoff algorithms. Numerical results for various radio propagation environments and cell selection as well as handoff schemes are provided and discussed.",1,Statistical Model of Downlink Power Consumption in Cellular CDMA  Networks
Railway grade crossing is become the major headache for the transportation system.

"The paper describes results on two components of a research program focused on motion-based communication mediated by the dynamics of a control system. Specifically we are interested in how mobile agents engaged in a shared activity such as dance can use motion as a medium for transmitting certain types of messages. The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion description languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known popular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several notions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which ten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then compared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also defined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion segments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human dancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are considered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the human judges' assessments of performance quality.  The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion control problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance step or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with a communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be given in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of finite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the cost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between prescribed pairs of states is independent of those states. At the same time, the optimal encoding problem itself is shown to be a problem of packing geometric objects, and it remains open.",1,The Control Theory of Motion-Based Communication: Problems in Teaching  Robots to Dance

"One of the most important challenges in the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid lies in their `intermittent' nature. The power output of sources like wind and solar varies with time and location due to factors that cannot be controlled by the provider. Two strategies have been proposed to hedge against this variability: 1) use energy storage systems to effectively average the produced power over time; 2) exploit distributed generation to effectively average production over location. We introduce a network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources in the presence of random energy sources. We propose a Linear-Quadratic based methodology to design control strategies, and we show that these strategies are asymptotically optimal for some simple network topologies. For these topologies, the dependence of optimal performance on storage and transmission capacity is explicitly quantified.",1,Distributed Storage for Intermittent Energy Sources: Control Design and  Performance Limits

"In this paper we introduce paraglide, a visualization system designed for interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multi-variate simulation models. To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to go back and forth between setting parameters and qualitatively judging the outcomes of their model. During this process, they build up a grounded understanding of the parameter effects in order to pick the right setting. Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions about parameter settings a tedious and workload-intensive task. Paraglide endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by assisting the sampling of the parameter space and the discovery of qualitatively different model outcomes. This results in a decomposition of the model parameter space into regions of distinct behaviour. We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and derived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal user-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies underlining the usefulness of our approach.",1,Paraglide: Interactive Parameter Space Partitioning for Computer  Simulations
"In this paper, we improve iterative greedy search algorithms in which atoms are selected serially over iterations, i.e., one-by-one over iterations. For serial atom selection, we devise two new schemes to select an atom from a set of potential atoms in each iteration. The two new schemes lead to two new algorithms. For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential atoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we propose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of potential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look ahead strategy such that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on the future iterations. The use of look ahead strategy requires a higher computational resource. To achieve a trade-off between performance and complexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new algorithm. Through experimental evaluations, we compare the proposed algorithms with existing greedy search and convex relaxation algorithms.",1,Projection-Based and Look Ahead Strategies for Atom Selection
"While service-dominant logic proposes that all Goods are a distribution mechanism for service provision (FP3), there is a need to understand when and why a firm would utilise direct or indirect (goods) service provision, and the interactions between them, to co-create value with the customer. Three longitudinal case studies in B2B equipment-based 'complex service' systems were analysed to gain an understanding of customers' co-creation activities to achieve outcomes. We found the nature of value, degree of contextual variety and the firm's legacy viability to be viability threats. To counter this, the firm uses (a) Direct Service Provision for Scalability and Replicability, (b) Indirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional value and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision for Scalability and Absorptive Resources of the customer. The co-creation of complex multidimensional value could be delivered through different value propositions of the firm. The research proposes a value-centric way of understanding the interactions between direct and indirect service provision in the design of the firm's value proposition and proposes a viable systems approach towards reorganising the firm. The study provides a way for managers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in co-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical systems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product design, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment. Through an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and human activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and it yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be redesigned, considering all activities equally.",1,"Value, Variety and Viability: Designing For Co-creation in a Complex  System of Direct and Indirect (goods) Service Value Proposition"

We apply this algorithm to optimize a fuzzy controller for a simple inverted pendulum with three rules.",1,Fast Hybrid PSO and Tabu Search Approach for Optimization of a Fuzzy  Controller
"In decentralized systems, branching behaviors naturally arise due to communication, unmodeled dynamics and system abstraction, which can not be adequately captured by the traditional sequencing-based language equivalence. As a finer behavior equivalence than language equivalence, bisimulation not only allows the full set of branching behaviors but also explicitly specifies the properties in terms of temporal logic such as CTL* and mu-calculus. This observation motivates us to consider the decentralized control of discrete event systems (DESs) for bisimulation equivalence in this paper, where the plant and the specification are taken to be nondeterministic and the supervisor is taken to be deterministic. An automata-based control framework is formalized, upon which we develop three architectures with respect to different decision fusion rules for the decentralized bisimilarity control, named a conjunctive architecture, a disjunctive architecture and a general architecture. Under theses three architectures, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of decentralized bisimilarity supervisors are derived respectively, which extend the traditional results of supervisory control from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence. It is shown that these conditions can be verified with exponential complexity. Furthermore, the synthesis of bisimilarity supervisors is presented when the existence condition holds.",1,Decentralized Supervisory Control of Discrete Event Systems for  Bisimulation Equivalence
"The output of renewable energy fluctuates significantly depending on weather conditions. We develop a unit commitment model to analyze requirements of the forecast output and its error for renewable energies. Our model obtains the time series for the operational state of thermal power plants that would maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants, photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an appropriate price structure.",1,A Unit Commitment Model with Demand Response for the Integration of  Renewable Energies
"The ongoing evolution of the electric power systems brings about the need to cope with increasingly complex interactions of technical components and relevant actors. In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical components such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the influence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.",1,Reliability Analysis of Electric Power Systems Using an Object-oriented  Hybrid Modeling Approach
"Recent papers have treated {\em control communication complexity} in the context of information-based, multiple agent control systems including nonlinear systems of the type that have been studied in connection with quantum information processing. The present paper continues this line of investigation into a class of two-agent distributed control systems in which the agents cooperate in order to realize common goals that are determined via independent actions undertaken individually by the agents. A basic assumption is that the actions taken are unknown in advance to the other agent. These goals can be conveniently summarized in the form of a {\em target matrix}, whose entries are computed by the control system responding to the choices of inputs made by the two agents. We show how to realize such target matrices for a broad class of systems that possess an input-output mapping that is bilinear. One can classify control-communication strategies, known as {\em control protocols}, according to the amount of information sharing occurring between the two agents. Protocols that assume no information sharing on the inputs that each agent selects and protocols that allow sufficient information sharing for identifying the common goals are the two extreme cases. Control protocols will also be evaluated and compared in terms of cost functionals given by integrated quadratic functions of the control inputs. The minimal control cost of the two classes of control protocols are analyzed and compared. The difference in the control costs between the two classes reflects an inherent trade-off between communication complexity and control cost.",1,Control Communication Complexity of Distributed Actions
"For a closed-loop system, which has a contention-based multiple access network on its sensor link, the Medium Access Controller (MAC) may discard some packets when the traffic on the link is high. We use a local state-based scheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this paper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in the presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based scheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to find. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find that certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical result of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a certainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an equivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen. Computing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a symmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a dual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures separation between scheduler, observer and controller. We present an example of this architecture, which illustrates a network-aware event-triggering mechanism.",1,Design of State-based Schedulers for a Network of Control Loops
"Networked control systems (NCS) are spatially distributed systems where communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a shared communication network. NCS have been studied for the last ten years and important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models. Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one symbol corresponds to an aggregate of continuous states. We consider a fairly general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth. We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control systems sharing a common communication network. The closed-loop NCS obtained is validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework.",1,A Symbolic Approach to the Design of Nonlinear Networked Control Systems
"This paper presents an input-output simulation approach to controlling multi-affine systems for linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, which consists of the following steps. First, we partition the state space into rectangles, each of which satisfies atomic LTL propositions. Then, we study the control of multi-affine systems on rectangles including the control of driving all trajectories starting from a rectangle to exit through a facet and the control of stabilizing the system towards a desired point. With the proposed controllers, a finitely abstracted transition system is constructed which is shown to be input-output simulated by the rectangular transition system of the multi-affine system. Since input-output simulation preserves LTL properties, the controller synthesis of the multi-affine system for LTL specifications is achieved by designing a nonblocking supervisor for the abstracted transition system and by continuously implementing the resulting supervisor for the original multi-affine system.",1,An Input-Output Simulation Approach to Controlling Multi-AffineSystems  for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications
"This paper investigates the supervisory control of nondeterministic discrete event systems to enforce bisimilarity with respect to deterministic specifications. A notion of synchronous simulation-based controllability is introduced as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a bisimilarity enforcing supervisor, and a polynomial algorithm is developed to verify such a condition. When the existence condition holds, a supervisor achieving bisimulation equivalence is constructed. Furthermore, when the existence condition does not hold, two different methods are provided for synthesizing maximal permissive sub-specifications.",1,Bisimilarity Enforcing Supervisory Control for Deterministic  Specifications

"Pneumatic pressure cells with thin metallic spherical diaphragm of shallow spherical shell configuration linked with vibrating wire pickup or vibrating cantilever pickup were reported in the past. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the pressure cell this work considers dual diaphragm structure fitted with cantilever pickup. The design and development of the pressure cell with this dual diaphragm structure having cantilever pickup is presented here. The geometrical design is optimally made as to sense either mono pressure or differential pressure resources. The cantilevers of the two diaphragms are excited to produce vibrations and the frequencies of vibrations are determined by picking up signals from orthogonally arranged opto-coupler links. With the computed frequency a lookup table is referred to obtain the pressure acting on the concerned diaphragm. In the external circuits, the average pressure and the differential pressure acting on two diaphragms are computed.

We propose two (linear) distributed algorithms, deterministic and gossip, respectively for the cases where the inter-agent communication is synchronous and asynchronous. Our contribution is that in both cases, the developed algorithms guarantee state averaging on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs; in particular, this graphical condition does not require that the network be balanced or symmetric, thereby extending many previous results in the literature. The key novelty of our approach is to augment an additional variable for each agent, called surplus, whose function is to locally record individual state updates. For convergence analysis, we employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools, with the eigenvalue perturbation theory playing a crucial role.",1,Average Consensus on General Strongly Connected Digraphs

We investigate a robust minimax least squares approach that minimizes a worst case difference regret. The regret is defined as the difference between a squared data error and the smallest attainable squared data error of a least squares estimator. We then propose a robust regularized least squares approach to the regularized least squares problem under data uncertainties by using a similar framework. We show that both unstructured and structured robust least squares problems and robust regularized least squares problem can be put in certain semi-definite programming forms. Through several simulations, we demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms with respect to the the well-known alternatives in the literature.",1,A Novel Robust Approach to Least Squares Problems with Bounded Data  Uncertainties
"Formulations of the turbo equalization approach to iterative equalization and decoding vary greatly when channel knowledge is either partially or completely unknown. Maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) approaches leverage channel knowledge to make explicit use of soft information (priors over the transmitted data bits) in a manner that is distinctly nonlinear, appearing either in a trellis formulation (MAP) or inside an inverted matrix (MMSE). To date, nearly all adaptive turbo equalization methods either estimate the channel or use a direct adaptation equalizer in which estimates of the transmitted data are formed from an expressly linear function of the received data and soft information, with this latter formulation being most common. We study a class of direct adaptation turbo equalizers that are both adaptive and nonlinear functions of the soft information from the decoder. We introduce piecewise linear models based on context trees that can adaptively approximate the nonlinear dependence of the equalizer on the soft information such that it can choose both the partition regions as well as the locally linear equalizer coefficients in each region independently, with computational complexity that remains of the order of a traditional direct adaptive linear equalizer. This approach is guaranteed to asymptotically achieve the performance of the best piecewise linear equalizer and we quantify the MSE performance of the resulting algorithm and the convergence of its MSE to that of the linear minimum MSE estimator as the depth of the context tree and the data length increase.",1,Linear MMSE-Optimal Turbo Equalization Using Context Trees
"We introduce a low complexity approach to iterative equalization and decoding, or turbo equalization, that uses clustered models to better match the nonlinear relationship that exists between likelihood information from a channel decoder and the symbol estimates that arise in soft-input channel equalization. The introduced clustered turbo equalizer uses piecewise linear models to capture the nonlinear dependency of the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) symbol estimate on the symbol likelihoods produced by the channel decoder and maintains a computational complexity that is only linear in the channel memory. By partitioning the space of likelihood information from the decoder, based on either hard or soft clustering, and using locally-linear adaptive equalizers within each clustered region, the performance gap between the linear MMSE equalizer and low-complexity, LMS-based linear turbo equalizers can be dramatically narrowed.",1,Low Complexity Turbo-Equalization: A Clustering Approach
"We introduce a new analysis of an adaptive mixture method that combines outputs of two constituent filters running in parallel to model an unknown desired signal. This adaptive mixture is shown to achieve the mean square error (MSE) performance of the best constituent filter, and in some cases outperforms both, in the steady-state. However, the MSE analysis of this mixture in the steady-state and during the transient regions uses approximations and relies on statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many cases, that are even chaotic. To this end, we perform the transient and the steady-state analysis of this adaptive mixture in a strong deterministic sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this adaptive mixture at any time to the time-accumulated squared estimation error of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent filters directly tuned to the underlying signal in an individual sequence manner.",1,A New Analysis of an Adaptive Convex Mixture: A Deterministic Approach

We adopt an approach based on regularization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) that takes into account both continuous and discrete time systems. The focus of the paper is on designing spaces that are well suited for temporal impulse response modeling. To this end, we construct and characterize general families of kernels that incorporate system properties such as stability, relative degree, absence of oscillatory behavior, smoothness, or delay. In addition, we discuss the possibility of automatically searching over these classes by means of kernel learning techniques, so as to capture different modes of the system to be identified.",1,Kernels for linear time invariant system identification
This work proposes to put up a tool for diagnosing multi faults based on model using techniques of detection and localization inspired from the community of artificial intelligence and that of automatic.

"In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal base station Discontinuous Transmission (BS-DTX) control and user scheduling for downlink coordinated MIMO systems with energy harvesting capability. To reduce the complexity and signaling overhead in practical systems, the BS-DTX control is adaptive to both the energy state information (ESI) and the data queue state information (QSI) over a longer timescale. The user scheduling is adaptive to the ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter timescale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control problem can be modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision Problem (POMDP), which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By using sample-path analysis and exploiting specific problem structure, we first obtain some structural results on the optimal control policy and derive an equivalent Bellman equation with reduced state space. To reduce the complexity and facilitate distributed implementation, we obtain a delay-aware distributed solution with the BS-DTX control at the BS controller (BSC) and the user scheduling at each cluster manager (CM) using approximate dynamic programming and distributed stochastic learning. We show that the proposed distributed two-timescale algorithm converges almost surely. Furthermore, using queueing theory, stochastic geometry and optimization techniques, we derive sufficient conditions for the data queues to be stable in the coordinated MIMO network and discuss various design insights.",1,Delay-aware BS Discontinuous Transmission Control and User Scheduling  for Energy Harvesting Downlink Coordinated MIMO Systems

The service quality assurance models, end to end Quality of Service (QoS) models, attempts made to QoS attributes are also found to be from individual perspectives of participating entities in a service process rather than a collective perspective considering individual QoS attributes rather than multiple QoS attributes. In light of these gaps we highlight the comparison between product oriented and pure online/ web service supply chains, a need for quality driven optimization in the web services supply chains, perceived complexities in the existing work and propose a conceptual model.",1,Web Services Supply Chains: A Literature Review
"The photovoltaic sun tracker allows us to increase the energy production. The sun tracker considered in this study has two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) and especially specified by the lack of sensors. In this way, the tracker will have as a set point the sun position at every second during the day for a period of five years. After sunset, the tracker goes back to the initial position (which of sunrise). The sliding mode control (SMC) will be applied to ensure at best the tracking mechanism and, in another hand, the sliding mode observer will replace the velocity sensor which suffers from a lot of measurement disturbances. Experimental measurements show that this autonomic dual axis Sun Tracker increases the power production by over 40%.",1,A Sliding Mode Control for a Sensorless Tracker: Application on a  Photovoltaic System
"We address the traffic light control problem for multiple intersections in tandem by viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic Flow Model (SFM) for it. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the controllable green and red cycle lengths. The IPA estimators obtained require counting traffic light switchings and estimating car flow rates only when specific events occur. The estimators are used to iteratively adjust light cycle lengths to improve performance and, in conjunction with a standard gradient-based algorithm, to obtain optimal values which adapt to changing traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the approach.",1,Multi-intersection Traffic Light Control Using Infinitesimal  Perturbation Analysis
"This paper investigates vision-based cooperative estimation of a 3D target object pose for visual sensor networks. In our previous works, we presented an estimation mechanism called networked visual motion observer achieving averaging of local pose estimates in real time. This paper extends the mechanism so that it works even in the presence of cameras not viewing the target due to the limited view angles and obstructions in order to fully take advantage of the networked vision system. Then, we analyze the averaging performance attained by the proposed mechanism and clarify a relation between the feedback gains in the algorithm and the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through simulation.",1,Vision-Based Cooperative Estimation of Averaged 3D Target Pose under  Imperfect Visibility
"This paper develops a controller synthesis method for distributed LQG control problems under output-feedback. We consider a system consisting of three interconnected linear subsystems with a delayed information sharing structure. While the state-feedback case has previously been solved, the extension to output-feedback is nontrivial as the classical separation principle fails. To find the optimal solution, the controller is decomposed into two independent components: a centralized LQG-optimal controller under delayed state observations, and a sum of correction terms based on additional local information available to decision makers. Explicit discrete-time equations are derived whose solutions are the gains of the optimal controller.",1,Distributed Output-Feedback LQG Control with Delayed Information Sharing
"High availability has always been one of the main problems for a data center. Till now high availability was achieved by host per host redundancy, a highly expensive method in terms of hardware and human costs. A new approach to the problem can be offered by virtualization. Using virtualization, it is possible to achieve a redundancy system for all the services running on a data center. This new approach to high availability allows the running virtual machines to be distributed over a small number of servers, by exploiting the features of the virtualization layer: start, stop and move virtual machines between physical hosts. The 3RC system is based on a finite state machine, providing the possibility to restart each virtual machine over any physical host, or reinstall it from scratch. A complete infrastructure has been developed to install operating system and middleware in a few minutes. To virtualize the main servers of a data center, a new procedure has been developed to migrate physical to virtual hosts. The whole Grid data center SNS-PISA is running at the moment in virtual environment under the high availability system.",1,High availability using virtualization - 3RC
The purpose of this work is to design a state feedback controller using Parametric Eigenstructure Assignment (PAE) technique that has the capacity to be reconfigured in the case that partial actuator faults occur.

"We define a special class of hybrid automata, called Deterministic and Transversal Linear Hybrid Automata (DTLHA), whose continuous dynamics in each location are linear time-invariant (LTI) with a constant input, and for which every discrete transition up to a given bounded time is deterministic and, importantly, transversal. For such a DTLHA starting from an initial state, we show that it is possible to compute an approximation of the reach set of a DTLHA over a finite time interval that is arbitrarily close to the exact reach set, called a bounded epsilon-reach set, through sampling and polyhedral over-approximation of sampled states. We propose an algorithm and an attendant architecture for the overall bounded epsilon-reach set computation process.",1,Bounded epsilon-Reach Set Computation of a Class of Deterministic and  Transversal Linear Hybrid Automata

"Information about the strength of gas sources in buildings has a number of applications in the area of building automation and control, including temperature and ventilation control, fire detection and security systems. Here, we consider the problem of estimating the strength of a gas source in an enclosure when some of the parameters of the gas transport process are unknown. Traditionally, these problems are either solved by the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) method which is accurate but computationally intense, or by Recursive Least Squares (RLS, also Kalman) filtering which is simpler but less accurate. In this paper, we suggest a different statistical estimation procedure based on the concept of Method of Moments. We outline techniques that make this procedure computationally efficient and amenable for recursive implementation. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed method based on experimental results as well as Monte-Carlo simulations. When used with the building control systems, these algorithms can estimate the gaseous strength in a room both quickly and accurately, and can potentially provide improved indoor air quality in an efficient manner.",1,Accurate Estimation of Gaseous Strength using Transient Data
"We consider the problem of maximizing the algebraic connectivity of the communication graph in a network of mobile robots by moving them into appropriate positions. We define the Laplacian of the graph as dependent on the pairwise distance between the robots and we approximate the problem as a sequence of Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). We propose a distributed solution consisting of local SDP's which use information only from nearby neighboring robots. We show that the resulting distributed optimization framework leads to feasible subproblems and through its repeated execution, the algebraic connectivity increases monotonically. Moreover, we describe how to adjust the communication load of the robots based on locally computable measures. Numerical simulations show the performance of the algorithm with respect to the centralized solution.",1,Constrained Distributed Algebraic Connectivity Maximization in Robotic  Networks
"In this paper we present a decentralized algorithm to estimate the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix that encodes the network topology of a multi-agent system. We consider network topologies modeled by undirected graphs. The basic idea is to provide a local interaction rule among agents so that their state trajectory is a linear combination of sinusoids oscillating only at frequencies function of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In this way, the problem of decentralized estimation of the eigenvalues is mapped into a standard signal processing problem in which the unknowns are the finite number of frequencies at which the signal oscillates.",1,Decentralized Estimation of Laplacian Eigenvalues in Multi-Agent Systems
"This paper describes the design and implementation of linear controllers with a switching condition for a nonlinear hot air blower system (HABS) process trainer PT326. The system is interfaced with a computer through a USB based data acquisition module and interfacing circuitry. A calibration equation is implemented through computer in order to convert the amplified output of the sensor to temperature. Overall plant is nonlinear; therefore, system identification is performed in three different regions depending upon the plant input. For these three regions, three linear controllers are designed with closed-loop system having small rise time, settling time and overshoot. Switching of controllers is based on regions defined by plant input. In order to avoid the effect of discontinuity, due to switching of linear controllers, parameters of all linear controllers are taken closer to each other. Finally, discretized controllers along with switching condition are implemented for the plant through computer and practical results are demonstrated.",1,Regional System Identification and Computer Based Switchable Control of  a Nonlinear Hot Air Blower System

"We present a subspace system identification method based on weighted nuclear norm approximation. The weight matrices used in the nuclear norm minimization are the same weights as used in standard subspace identification methods. We show that the inclusion of the weights improves the performance in terms of fit on validation data. As a second benefit, the weights reduce the size of the optimization problems that need to be solved. Experimental results from randomly generated examples as well as from the Daisy benchmark collection are reported. The key to an efficient implementation is the use of the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem.",1,Subspace System Identification via Weighted Nuclear Norm Optimization
"In this paper, we study cooperative multi-agent systems in which the target objective and the controls exercised by the agents are dependent on the choices they made at initial system time. Such systems have been investigated in several recently published papers, mainly from the perspective of system analysis on issues such as control communication complexity, control energy cost and the feasibility of realization of target functions. This paper continues this line of research by developing optimal control design methodology for linear systems that are collaboratively manipulated by multiple agents based on their distributed choices. For target matrices that satisfy particular structural constraints, we derive control algorithms that can achieve the specified targets with minimum control cost. We compare state-feedback as well as open-loop control strategies for target realization and extend the optimality result to an arbitrary target matrix. The optimal control solutions are obtained by minimizing the average control cost subject to the set of specified target-state constraints by means of modern variation theory and the Lagrange multiplier method.",1,Cooperative Target Realization in Multi-Agent Systems Allowing  Choice-Based Actions
"Several design parameters in collective robotic systems have been investigated and developed in order to explore the cooperation among the autonomous robotic individuals in a variety of robotic swarms in the presence of different internal and external system constraints.

"A smart grid delivers power around the country and has an intelligent monitoring system, which not only keeps track of all the energy coming in from diverse sources but also can detect where energy is needed through a two-way communication system that collects data about how and when consumers use power. It is safer in many ways, compared with the current one-directional power supply system that seems susceptible to either sabotage or natural disasters, including being more resistant to attack and power outages. In such an autonomic and advanced-grid environment, investing in a pilot study and knowing the nation readiness to adopt a smart grid absolves the government of complex intervention from any failure to bring Japan into the autonomic-grid environment. This paper looks closely into the concept of the Japanese government go green effort, the objective of which is to make Japan a leading nation in environmental and energy sustainability through green innovation, such as creating a low-carbon society and embracing the natural grid community.

"In this paper we introduce the problem of dynamic pricing of power for smart-grid networks. This is studied within a network utility maximization (NUM) framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple users and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in a (deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge the users. The users then adjust their demand in response to the time-varying prices. This is typically categorized as the demand response problem, and we study a progression of related models by focusing on two aspects: 1) the characterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic prices in the Smart Grid and the optimal demand and supply under various interaction with a spot market; 2) a greedy approach to facilitate the solution process of the aggregate NUM problem and the optimality gap between the greedy solution and the optimal one.",1,Dynamic Pricing of Power in Smart-Grid Networks
"In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is proposed for a nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system subject to bounded time varying uncertainty which satisfies a certain integral quadratic constraint condition. The scheme develops a robust feedback linarization approach which uses standard feedback linearization approach to linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of the uncertain nonlinear system and linearizes the nonlinear time varying uncertainties at an arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach transforms uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems into an equivalent MIMO linear uncertain system model with unstructured uncertainty. Finally, a robust minimax linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design is proposed for the linearized model. The scheme guarantees the internal stability of the closed loop system and provides robust performance. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, the proposed method is applied to a tracking control problem for an air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle (AHFV).",1,Minimax Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control of Nonlinear MIMO System with  Time Varying Uncertainties
"In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process. Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss - widely known as the price of anarchy - the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail. This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system.",1,Efficiency-Risk Tradeoffs in Dynamic Oligopoly Markets - with  application to electricity markets

"A straight forward application of feedback linearization to the missile autopilot design for acceleration control may be limited due to the nonminimum characteristics and the model uncertainties. As a remedy, this paper presents a cascade structure of an acceleration controller based on approximate feedback linearization methodology with a time-delay adaptation scheme. The inner loop controller is constructed by applying feedback linearization to the approximate system which is a minimum phase system and provides the desired acceleration signal caused by the angle-of-attack. This controller is augmented by the time-delay adaptive law and the outer loop PI (proportional-integral) controller in order to adaptively compensate for feedback linearization error because of model uncertainty and in order to track the desired acceleration signal. The performance of the proposed method is examined through numerical simulations. Moreover, the proposed controller is tested by using an intercept scenario in 6DOF nonlinear simulations.",1,Missile Acceleration Controller Design using PI and Time-Delay Adaptive  Feedback Linearization Methodology

"We employ supervisory controllers to safely coordinate high-level discrete(-event) behavior of distributed components of complex systems. Supervisory controllers observe discrete-event system behavior, make a decision on allowed activities, and communicate the control signals to the involved parties. Models of the supervisory controllers can be automatically synthesized based on formal models of the system components and a formalization of the safe coordination (control) requirements. Based on the obtained models, code generation can be used to implement the supervisory controllers in software, on a PLC, or an embedded (micro)processor. In this article, we develop a process theory with data that supports a model-based systems engineering framework for supervisory coordination. We employ communication to distinguish between the different flows of information, i.e., observation and supervision, whereas we employ data to specify the coordination requirements more compactly, and to increase the expressivity of the framework. To illustrate the framework, we remodel an industrial case study involving coordination of maintenance procedures of a printing process of a high-tech Oce printer.",1,Communicating Processes with Data for Supervisory Coordination

It is based on existing solutions to pertinent matrix nearness problems. It is shown that the key point in constructing the nearest passive transfer function, is to find a good rational approximation of the well-known ramp function over an interval defined by the minimum and maximum dissipation of H(s).

"Our goal is to achieve a high degree of fault tolerance through the control of a safety critical systems. This reduces to solving a game between a malicious environment that injects failures and a controller who tries to establish a correct behavior. We suggest a new control objective for such systems that offers a better balance between complexity and precision: we seek systems that are k-resilient. In order to be k-resilient, a system needs to be able to rapidly recover from a small number, up to k, of local faults infinitely many times, provided that blocks of up to k faults are separated by short recovery periods in which no fault occurs. k-resilience is a simple but powerful abstraction from the precise distribution of local faults, but much more refined than the traditional objective to maximize the number of local faults. We argue why we believe this to be the right level of abstraction for safety critical systems when local faults are few and far between. We show that the computational complexity of constructing optimal control with respect to resilience is low and demonstrate the feasibility through an implementation and experimental results.",1,Rapid Recovery for Systems with Scarce Faults

"Convenience and safeguarding our home appliances have become an important issue when dealing with an advancement and growth of an economy. This research focuses on the design and construction of a Dual Sensor heat-monitoring system. The circuit works by monitoring temperature from an external input and comparing the temperature level with that of a preset temperature value. The power output of the circuit is cut off or switched OFF or an alarm is triggered ON if the temperature of the external input is equal to or, greater than the preset temperature value. The methodology involves the application of linear precision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly proportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using temperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power supply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is switched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON when the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of the system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between the preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an emerging learning paradigm for nonlinear regression problems and has shown its effectiveness in the machine learning community. An important feature of ELM is that the learning speed is extremely fast thanks to its random projection preprocessing step.

"Recovery of the initial state of a high-dimensional system can require a large number of measurements. In this paper, we explain how this burden can be significantly reduced when randomized measurement operators are employed. Our work builds upon recent results from Compressive Sensing (CS). In particular, we make the connection to CS analysis for random block diagonal matrices. By deriving Concentration of Measure (CoM) inequalities, we show that the observability matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) (a sufficient condition for stable recovery of sparse vectors) under certain conditions on the state transition matrix. For example, we show that if the state transition matrix is unitary, and if independent, randomly-populated measurement matrices are employed, then it is possible to uniquely recover a sparse high-dimensional initial state when the total number of measurements scales linearly in the sparsity level (the number of non-zero entries) of the initial state and logarithmically in the state dimension. We further extend our RIP analysis for scaled unitary and symmetric state transition matrices. We support our analysis with a case study of a two-dimensional diffusion process.",1,Technical Report: Observability with Random Observations

By additive state decomposition and a new definition of output, the considered uncertain system is transformed into a minimum-phase uncertainty-free system with relative degree one, in which all uncertainties are lumped into a new disturbance at the output. Subsequently, dynamic inversion control is applied to reject the lumped disturbance. Performance analysis of the resulting closed-loop dynamics shows that the stability can be ensured. Finally, to demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed control is applied to two existing problems by numerical simulation. Furthermore, in order to show its practicability, the proposed control is also performed on a real quadrotor to stabilize its attitude when its inertia moment matrix is subject to a large uncertainty.",1,Additive-State-Decomposition Dynamic Inversion Stabilized Control for a  Class of Uncertain MIMO Systems

A predictive control scheme for a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is presented. It is based on a suboptimal method for computationally efficient trajectory generation based on continuous parameterization and linear programming. The torque controller optimizes a quadratic cost consisting of control error and machine losses in real-time respecting voltage and current limitations. The multivariable controller decouples the two current components and exploits cross-coupling effects in the long-range constrained predictive control strategy.

"Digital equipment such as computers, telecommunication systems and instruments use microprocessors that operate at high frequencies allowing them to carry out millions or even billions of operations per second. A disturbance in the electrical supply lasting just a few milliseconds can affect thousands or millions of basic operations. The result may be malfunctioning and loss of data with dangerous or costly consequences (e.g. loss of production). That is why many loads, called sensitive or critical loads, require a supply that is protected. Many manufacturers of sensitive equipment specify very strict tolerances, much stricter than those in the distribution system for the supply of their equipment, one example being Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers Association for computer equipment against distribution system disturbances. The design of this uninterrupted power supply (UPS) for personal computer (PC) is necessitated due to a need for enhanced portability in the design of personal computer desktop workstations. Apart from its original functionality as a backup source of power, this design incorporates the unit within the system unit casing, thereby reducing the number of system components available. Also, the embedding of this unit removes the untidiness of connecting wires and makes the whole computer act like a laptop.

"It has been shown that max-plus linear systems are well suited for applications in synchronization and scheduling, such as the generation of train timetables, manufacturing, or traffic. In this paper we show that the same is true for multi-legged locomotion. In this framework, the max-plus eigenvalue of the system matrix represents the total cycle time, whereas the max-plus eigenvector dictates the steady-state behavior. Uniqueness of the eigenstructure also indicates uniqueness of the resulting behavior. For the particular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to two-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground, respectively). The generation of a gait (a manner of walking) for a multiple legged robot is then achieved by synchronizing the multiple discrete-event cycles via the max-plus framework. By construction, different gaits and gait parameters can be safely interleaved by using different system matrices. In this paper we address both the transient and steady-state behavior for a class of gaits by presenting closed-form expressions for the max-plus eigenvalue and max-plus eigenvector of the system matrix and the coupling time. The significance of this result is in showing guaranteed robustness to perturbations and gait switching, and also a systematic methodology for synthesizing controllers that allow for legged robots to change rhythms fast.",1,Synchronization of a class of cyclic discrete-event systems describing  legged locomotion
"We present a novel method called Kernel-SME filter for tracking multiple targets when the association of the measurements to the targets is unknown. The method is a further development of the Symmetric Measurement Equation (SME) filter, which removes the data association uncertainty of the original measurement equation with the help of a symmetric transformation. The underlying idea of the Kernel-SME filter is to construct a symmetric transformation by means of mapping the measurements to a Gaussian mixture. This transformation is scalable to a large number of targets and allows for deriving a Gaussian state estimator that has a cubic time complexity in the number of targets.",1,The Kernel-SME Filter for Multiple Target Tracking
The PID controller parameters can be adjusted in such a manner that it gives the desired frequency response and the results are found using the Bodes integral formula in order to adjust the slope of the nyquist curve in a desired manner. The same idea is applied for plants with time delay . The same has also been done in a new approach . The delay term is approximated as a transfer function using Pade approximation and then the Bode integral is used to determine the controller parameters. Both the methodologies are demonstrated with MATLAB simulation of representative plants and accompanying PID controllers. A proper comparison of the two methodologies is also done. The PID controller parameters are also tuned using a real coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a proper comparison is done between the three methods.,1,Stability Analysis Of Delayed System Using Bodes Integral
"Microgrid (MG) is a promising component for future smart grid (SG) deployment. The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the most important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel framework for smart energy management based on the concept of quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require any statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price processes. We derive several hard performance bounds for the proposed algorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity scheduling algorithm.",1,Adaptive Electricity Scheduling in Microgrids
"We analyze a distributed algorithm for estimation of scalar parameters belonging to nodes in a mobile network from noisy relative measurements. The motivation comes from the problem of clock skew and offset estimation for the purpose of time synchronization. The time variation of the network was modeled as a Markov chain. The estimates are shown to be mean square convergent under fairly weak assumptions on the Markov chain, as long as the union of the graphs is connected. Expressions for the asymptotic mean and correlation are also provided. The Markovian switching topology model of mobile networks is justified for certain node mobility models through empirically estimated conditional entropy measures.",1,Estimation from Relative Measurements in Mobile Networks with Markovian  Switching Topology: Clock Skew and Offset Estimation for Time Synchronization
We propose a new modeling paradigm for large dimensional aggregates of stochastic systems by Generalized Factor Analysis (GFA) models. These models describe the data as the sum of a flocking plus an uncorrelated idiosyncratic component. The flocking component describes a sort of collective orderly motion which admits a much simpler mathematical description than the whole ensemble while the idiosyncratic component describes weakly correlated noise. We first discuss static GFA representations and characterize in a rigorous way the properties of the two components. The extraction of the dynamic flocking component is discussed for time-stationary linear systems and for a simple classes of separable random fields.,1,Modeling complex systems by Generalized Factor Analysis
"The guidance of a torpedo represents a hard task because of the smooth nonlinear aspect of this system and because of the extreme external disturbances. The torpedo guidance reposes on the speed and the position control. In fact, the control approach which is very solicited for the electromechanical systems is the sliding mode control (SMC) which proved its effectiveness through the different studies. The SMC is robust versus disturbances and model uncertainties; however, a sharp discontinuous control is needed which induces the chattering phenomenon. The angular velocity measurement is a hard task because of the high level of disturbances. In this way, the sliding mode observer could be a solution for the velocity estimation instead of a sensor. This article deals with torpedo guidance by SMC to reach the desired path in a short time and with high precision quality. Simulation results show that this control strategy and observer can attain excellent control performances with no chattering problem.",1,A High-Order Sliding Mode Observer: Torpedo Guidance Application
