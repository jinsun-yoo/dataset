"Present work proposes a theoretical statistical model of the downlink power consumption in cellular CDMA networks. The proposed model employs a simple but popular propagation model, which breaks down path losses into a distance dependent and a log-normal shadowing loss term. Based on the aforementioned path loss formalism, closed-form expressions for the first and the second moment of power consumption are obtained taking into account conditions placed by cell selection and handoff algorithms. Numerical results for various radio propagation environments and cell selection as well as handoff schemes are provided and discussed.",1,Statistical Model of Downlink Power Consumption in Cellular CDMA  Networks
Railway grade crossing is become the major headache for the transportation system. This paper describes an intelligent railway crossing control system for multiple tracks that features a controller which receives messages from incoming and outgoing trains by sensors. These messages contain detail information including the direction and identity of a train. Depending on those messages the controller device decides whenever the railroad crossing gate will close or open.,1,A Radio Based Intelligent Railway Grade Crossing System to Avoid  Collision

"The paper describes results on two components of a research program focused on motion-based communication mediated by the dynamics of a control system. Specifically we are interested in how mobile agents engaged in a shared activity such as dance can use motion as a medium for transmitting certain types of messages. The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion description languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known popular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several notions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which ten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then compared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also defined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion segments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human dancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are considered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the human judges' assessments of performance quality.  The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion control problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance step or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with a communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be given in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of finite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the cost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between prescribed pairs of states is independent of those states. At the same time, the optimal encoding problem itself is shown to be a problem of packing geometric objects, and it remains open.",1,The Control Theory of Motion-Based Communication: Problems in Teaching  Robots to Dance

The performance of LAD, zero-attracting LAD (ZA-LAD) and reweighted zero-attracting LAD (RZA-LAD) are evaluated for linear time varying system identification under the non-Gaussian (alpha-stable) noise environments. Effectiveness of the ZA-LAD type algorithms is demonstrated through computer simulations.",1,System Identification Using Reweighted Zero Attracting Least Absolute  Deviation Algorithm
"One of the most important challenges in the integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid lies in their `intermittent' nature. The power output of sources like wind and solar varies with time and location due to factors that cannot be controlled by the provider. Two strategies have been proposed to hedge against this variability: 1) use energy storage systems to effectively average the produced power over time; 2) exploit distributed generation to effectively average production over location. We introduce a network model to study the optimal use of storage and transmission resources in the presence of random energy sources. We propose a Linear-Quadratic based methodology to design control strategies, and we show that these strategies are asymptotically optimal for some simple network topologies. For these topologies, the dependence of optimal performance on storage and transmission capacity is explicitly quantified.",1,Distributed Storage for Intermittent Energy Sources: Control Design and  Performance Limits

"In this paper we introduce paraglide, a visualization system designed for interactive exploration of parameter spaces of multi-variate simulation models. To get the right parameter configuration, model developers frequently have to go back and forth between setting parameters and qualitatively judging the outcomes of their model. During this process, they build up a grounded understanding of the parameter effects in order to pick the right setting. Current state-of-the-art tools and practices, however, fail to provide a systematic way of exploring these parameter spaces, making informed decisions about parameter settings a tedious and workload-intensive task. Paraglide endeavors to overcome this shortcoming by assisting the sampling of the parameter space and the discovery of qualitatively different model outcomes. This results in a decomposition of the model parameter space into regions of distinct behaviour. We developed paraglide in close collaboration with experts from three different domains, who all were involved in developing new models for their domain. We first analyzed current practices of six domain experts and derived a set of design requirements, then engaged in a longitudinal user-centered design process, and finally conducted three in-depth case studies underlining the usefulness of our approach.",1,Paraglide: Interactive Parameter Space Partitioning for Computer  Simulations
"In this paper, we improve iterative greedy search algorithms in which atoms are selected serially over iterations, i.e., one-by-one over iterations. For serial atom selection, we devise two new schemes to select an atom from a set of potential atoms in each iteration. The two new schemes lead to two new algorithms. For both the algorithms, in each iteration, the set of potential atoms is found using a standard matched filter. In case of the first scheme, we propose an orthogonal projection strategy that selects an atom from the set of potential atoms. Then, for the second scheme, we propose a look ahead strategy such that the selection of an atom in the current iteration has an effect on the future iterations. The use of look ahead strategy requires a higher computational resource. To achieve a trade-off between performance and complexity, we use the two new schemes in cascade and develop a third new algorithm. Through experimental evaluations, we compare the proposed algorithms with existing greedy search and convex relaxation algorithms.",1,Projection-Based and Look Ahead Strategies for Atom Selection
"While service-dominant logic proposes that all Goods are a distribution mechanism for service provision (FP3), there is a need to understand when and why a firm would utilise direct or indirect (goods) service provision, and the interactions between them, to co-create value with the customer. Three longitudinal case studies in B2B equipment-based 'complex service' systems were analysed to gain an understanding of customers' co-creation activities to achieve outcomes. We found the nature of value, degree of contextual variety and the firm's legacy viability to be viability threats. To counter this, the firm uses (a) Direct Service Provision for Scalability and Replicability, (b) Indirect Service Provision for variety absorption and co-creating emotional value and customer experience and (c) designing direct and indirect provision for Scalability and Absorptive Resources of the customer. The co-creation of complex multidimensional value could be delivered through different value propositions of the firm. The research proposes a value-centric way of understanding the interactions between direct and indirect service provision in the design of the firm's value proposition and proposes a viable systems approach towards reorganising the firm. The study provides a way for managers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of the firm in co-creating value as a major issue in the design of complex socio-technical systems. Goods are often designed within the domain of engineering and product design, often placing human activity as a supporting role to the equipment. Through an SDLogic lens, this study considers the design of both equipment and human activity on an equal footing for value co-creation with the customer, and it yielded interesting results on when direct provisioning (goods) should be redesigned, considering all activities equally.",1,"Value, Variety and Viability: Designing For Co-creation in a Complex  System of Direct and Indirect (goods) Service Value Proposition"

We apply this algorithm to optimize a fuzzy controller for a simple inverted pendulum with three rules.",1,Fast Hybrid PSO and Tabu Search Approach for Optimization of a Fuzzy  Controller
"In decentralized systems, branching behaviors naturally arise due to communication, unmodeled dynamics and system abstraction, which can not be adequately captured by the traditional sequencing-based language equivalence. As a finer behavior equivalence than language equivalence, bisimulation not only allows the full set of branching behaviors but also explicitly specifies the properties in terms of temporal logic such as CTL* and mu-calculus. This observation motivates us to consider the decentralized control of discrete event systems (DESs) for bisimulation equivalence in this paper, where the plant and the specification are taken to be nondeterministic and the supervisor is taken to be deterministic. An automata-based control framework is formalized, upon which we develop three architectures with respect to different decision fusion rules for the decentralized bisimilarity control, named a conjunctive architecture, a disjunctive architecture and a general architecture. Under theses three architectures, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of decentralized bisimilarity supervisors are derived respectively, which extend the traditional results of supervisory control from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence. It is shown that these conditions can be verified with exponential complexity. Furthermore, the synthesis of bisimilarity supervisors is presented when the existence condition holds.",1,Decentralized Supervisory Control of Discrete Event Systems for  Bisimulation Equivalence
"The output of renewable energy fluctuates significantly depending on weather conditions. We develop a unit commitment model to analyze requirements of the forecast output and its error for renewable energies. Our model obtains the time series for the operational state of thermal power plants that would maximize the profits of an electric power utility by taking into account both the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response of consumers. We consider a power system consisting of thermal power plants, photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand balance; some of these plants can be decommissioned after installing a large number of wind farms or PV systems, if the demand response is applied using an appropriate price structure.",1,A Unit Commitment Model with Demand Response for the Integration of  Renewable Energies
"The ongoing evolution of the electric power systems brings about the need to cope with increasingly complex interactions of technical components and relevant actors. In order to integrate a more comprehensive spectrum of different aspects into a probabilistic reliability assessment and to include time-dependent effects, this paper proposes an object-oriented hybrid approach combining agent-based modeling techniques with classical methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. Objects represent both technical components such as generators and transmission lines and non-technical components such as grid operators. The approach allows the calculation of conventional reliability indices and the estimation of blackout frequencies. Furthermore, the influence of the time needed to remove line overloads on the overall system reliability can be assessed. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by performing simulations on the IEEE Reliability Test System 1996 and on a model of the Swiss high-voltage grid.",1,Reliability Analysis of Electric Power Systems Using an Object-oriented  Hybrid Modeling Approach
"Recent papers have treated {\em control communication complexity} in the context of information-based, multiple agent control systems including nonlinear systems of the type that have been studied in connection with quantum information processing. The present paper continues this line of investigation into a class of two-agent distributed control systems in which the agents cooperate in order to realize common goals that are determined via independent actions undertaken individually by the agents. A basic assumption is that the actions taken are unknown in advance to the other agent. These goals can be conveniently summarized in the form of a {\em target matrix}, whose entries are computed by the control system responding to the choices of inputs made by the two agents. We show how to realize such target matrices for a broad class of systems that possess an input-output mapping that is bilinear. One can classify control-communication strategies, known as {\em control protocols}, according to the amount of information sharing occurring between the two agents. Protocols that assume no information sharing on the inputs that each agent selects and protocols that allow sufficient information sharing for identifying the common goals are the two extreme cases. Control protocols will also be evaluated and compared in terms of cost functionals given by integrated quadratic functions of the control inputs. The minimal control cost of the two classes of control protocols are analyzed and compared. The difference in the control costs between the two classes reflects an inherent trade-off between communication complexity and control cost.",1,Control Communication Complexity of Distributed Actions
"For a closed-loop system, which has a contention-based multiple access network on its sensor link, the Medium Access Controller (MAC) may discard some packets when the traffic on the link is high. We use a local state-based scheduler to select a few critical data packets to send to the MAC. In this paper, we analyze the impact of such a scheduler on the closed-loop system in the presence of traffic, and show that there is a dual effect with state-based scheduling. In general, this makes the optimal scheduler and controller hard to find. However, by removing past controls from the scheduling criterion, we find that certainty equivalence holds. This condition is related to the classical result of Bar-Shalom and Tse, and it leads to the design of a scheduler with a certainty equivalent controller. This design, however, does not result in an equivalent system to the original problem, in the sense of Witsenhausen. Computing the estimate is difficult, but can be simplified by introducing a symmetry constraint on the scheduler. Based on these findings, we propose a dual predictor architecture for the closed-loop system, which ensures separation between scheduler, observer and controller. We present an example of this architecture, which illustrates a network-aware event-triggering mechanism.",1,Design of State-based Schedulers for a Network of Control Loops
"Networked control systems (NCS) are spatially distributed systems where communication among plants, sensors, actuators and controllers occurs in a shared communication network. NCS have been studied for the last ten years and important research results have been obtained. These results are in the area of stability and stabilizability. However, while important, these results must be complemented in different areas to be able to design effective NCS. In this paper we approach the control design of NCS using symbolic (finite) models. Symbolic models are abstract descriptions of continuous systems where one symbol corresponds to an aggregate of continuous states. We consider a fairly general multiple-loop network architecture where plants communicate with digital controllers through a shared, non-ideal, communication network characterized by variable sampling and transmission intervals, variable communication delays, quantization errors, packet losses and limited bandwidth. We first derive a procedure to obtain symbolic models that are proven to approximate NCS in the sense of alternating approximate bisimulation. We then use these symbolic models to design symbolic controllers that realize specifications expressed in terms of automata on infinite strings. An example is provided where we address the control design of a pair of nonlinear control systems sharing a common communication network. The closed-loop NCS obtained is validated through the OMNeT++ network simulation framework.",1,A Symbolic Approach to the Design of Nonlinear Networked Control Systems
"This paper presents an input-output simulation approach to controlling multi-affine systems for linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications, which consists of the following steps. First, we partition the state space into rectangles, each of which satisfies atomic LTL propositions. Then, we study the control of multi-affine systems on rectangles including the control of driving all trajectories starting from a rectangle to exit through a facet and the control of stabilizing the system towards a desired point. With the proposed controllers, a finitely abstracted transition system is constructed which is shown to be input-output simulated by the rectangular transition system of the multi-affine system. Since input-output simulation preserves LTL properties, the controller synthesis of the multi-affine system for LTL specifications is achieved by designing a nonblocking supervisor for the abstracted transition system and by continuously implementing the resulting supervisor for the original multi-affine system.",1,An Input-Output Simulation Approach to Controlling Multi-AffineSystems  for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications
"This paper investigates the supervisory control of nondeterministic discrete event systems to enforce bisimilarity with respect to deterministic specifications. A notion of synchronous simulation-based controllability is introduced as a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a bisimilarity enforcing supervisor, and a polynomial algorithm is developed to verify such a condition. When the existence condition holds, a supervisor achieving bisimulation equivalence is constructed. Furthermore, when the existence condition does not hold, two different methods are provided for synthesizing maximal permissive sub-specifications.",1,Bisimilarity Enforcing Supervisory Control for Deterministic  Specifications

"Pneumatic pressure cells with thin metallic spherical diaphragm of shallow spherical shell configuration linked with vibrating wire pickup or vibrating cantilever pickup were reported in the past. In order to enhance the sensitivity of the pressure cell this work considers dual diaphragm structure fitted with cantilever pickup. The design and development of the pressure cell with this dual diaphragm structure having cantilever pickup is presented here. The geometrical design is optimally made as to sense either mono pressure or differential pressure resources. The cantilevers of the two diaphragms are excited to produce vibrations and the frequencies of vibrations are determined by picking up signals from orthogonally arranged opto-coupler links. With the computed frequency a lookup table is referred to obtain the pressure acting on the concerned diaphragm. In the external circuits, the average pressure and the differential pressure acting on two diaphragms are computed.

"We study the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems for general network topologies with unidirectional information flow. We propose two (linear) distributed algorithms, deterministic and gossip, respectively for the cases where the inter-agent communication is synchronous and asynchronous. Our contribution is that in both cases, the developed algorithms guarantee state averaging on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs; in particular, this graphical condition does not require that the network be balanced or symmetric, thereby extending many previous results in the literature. The key novelty of our approach is to augment an additional variable for each agent, called surplus, whose function is to locally record individual state updates. For convergence analysis, we employ graph-theoretic and nonnegative matrix tools, with the eigenvalue perturbation theory playing a crucial role.",1,Average Consensus on General Strongly Connected Digraphs

The approach is based on a variable optimization horizon length and contractive final state constraint sets.

The varying optimization horizon along with the contractive constraints are used to achieve analytic asymptotic stability of the system under the proposed scheme. The strategy is demonstrated by simulation examples.",1,A Receding Horizon Strategy for Systems with Interval-Wise Energy  Constraints

We investigate a robust minimax least squares approach that minimizes a worst case difference regret. The regret is defined as the difference between a squared data error and the smallest attainable squared data error of a least squares estimator. We then propose a robust regularized least squares approach to the regularized least squares problem under data uncertainties by using a similar framework. We show that both unstructured and structured robust least squares problems and robust regularized least squares problem can be put in certain semi-definite programming forms. Through several simulations, we demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms with respect to the the well-known alternatives in the literature.",1,A Novel Robust Approach to Least Squares Problems with Bounded Data  Uncertainties
"Formulations of the turbo equalization approach to iterative equalization and decoding vary greatly when channel knowledge is either partially or completely unknown. Maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) approaches leverage channel knowledge to make explicit use of soft information (priors over the transmitted data bits) in a manner that is distinctly nonlinear, appearing either in a trellis formulation (MAP) or inside an inverted matrix (MMSE). To date, nearly all adaptive turbo equalization methods either estimate the channel or use a direct adaptation equalizer in which estimates of the transmitted data are formed from an expressly linear function of the received data and soft information, with this latter formulation being most common. We study a class of direct adaptation turbo equalizers that are both adaptive and nonlinear functions of the soft information from the decoder. We introduce piecewise linear models based on context trees that can adaptively approximate the nonlinear dependence of the equalizer on the soft information such that it can choose both the partition regions as well as the locally linear equalizer coefficients in each region independently, with computational complexity that remains of the order of a traditional direct adaptive linear equalizer. This approach is guaranteed to asymptotically achieve the performance of the best piecewise linear equalizer and we quantify the MSE performance of the resulting algorithm and the convergence of its MSE to that of the linear minimum MSE estimator as the depth of the context tree and the data length increase.",1,Linear MMSE-Optimal Turbo Equalization Using Context Trees
"We introduce a low complexity approach to iterative equalization and decoding, or turbo equalization, that uses clustered models to better match the nonlinear relationship that exists between likelihood information from a channel decoder and the symbol estimates that arise in soft-input channel equalization. The introduced clustered turbo equalizer uses piecewise linear models to capture the nonlinear dependency of the linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) symbol estimate on the symbol likelihoods produced by the channel decoder and maintains a computational complexity that is only linear in the channel memory. By partitioning the space of likelihood information from the decoder, based on either hard or soft clustering, and using locally-linear adaptive equalizers within each clustered region, the performance gap between the linear MMSE equalizer and low-complexity, LMS-based linear turbo equalizers can be dramatically narrowed.",1,Low Complexity Turbo-Equalization: A Clustering Approach
"We introduce a new analysis of an adaptive mixture method that combines outputs of two constituent filters running in parallel to model an unknown desired signal. This adaptive mixture is shown to achieve the mean square error (MSE) performance of the best constituent filter, and in some cases outperforms both, in the steady-state. However, the MSE analysis of this mixture in the steady-state and during the transient regions uses approximations and relies on statistical models on the underlying signals and systems. Hence, such an analysis may not be useful or valid for signals generated by various real life systems that show high degrees of nonstationarity, limit cycles and, in many cases, that are even chaotic. To this end, we perform the transient and the steady-state analysis of this adaptive mixture in a strong deterministic sense without any approximations in the derivations or statistical assumptions on the underlying signals such that our results are guaranteed to hold. In particular, we relate the time-accumulated squared estimation error of this adaptive mixture at any time to the time-accumulated squared estimation error of the optimal convex mixture of the constituent filters directly tuned to the underlying signal in an individual sequence manner.",1,A New Analysis of an Adaptive Convex Mixture: A Deterministic Approach

We adopt an approach based on regularization in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) that takes into account both continuous and discrete time systems. The focus of the paper is on designing spaces that are well suited for temporal impulse response modeling. To this end, we construct and characterize general families of kernels that incorporate system properties such as stability, relative degree, absence of oscillatory behavior, smoothness, or delay. In addition, we discuss the possibility of automatically searching over these classes by means of kernel learning techniques, so as to capture different modes of the system to be identified.",1,Kernels for linear time invariant system identification
This work proposes to put up a tool for diagnosing multi faults based on model using techniques of detection and localization inspired from the community of artificial intelligence and that of automatic.

"In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal base station Discontinuous Transmission (BS-DTX) control and user scheduling for downlink coordinated MIMO systems with energy harvesting capability. To reduce the complexity and signaling overhead in practical systems, the BS-DTX control is adaptive to both the energy state information (ESI) and the data queue state information (QSI) over a longer timescale. The user scheduling is adaptive to the ESI, the QSI and the channel state information (CSI) over a shorter timescale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control problem can be modeled as an infinite horizon average cost Partially Observed Markov Decision Problem (POMDP), which is well-known to be a difficult problem in general. By using sample-path analysis and exploiting specific problem structure, we first obtain some structural results on the optimal control policy and derive an equivalent Bellman equation with reduced state space. To reduce the complexity and facilitate distributed implementation, we obtain a delay-aware distributed solution with the BS-DTX control at the BS controller (BSC) and the user scheduling at each cluster manager (CM) using approximate dynamic programming and distributed stochastic learning. We show that the proposed distributed two-timescale algorithm converges almost surely. Furthermore, using queueing theory, stochastic geometry and optimization techniques, we derive sufficient conditions for the data queues to be stable in the coordinated MIMO network and discuss various design insights.",1,Delay-aware BS Discontinuous Transmission Control and User Scheduling  for Energy Harvesting Downlink Coordinated MIMO Systems

"The photovoltaic sun tracker allows us to increase the energy production. The sun tracker considered in this study has two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) and especially specified by the lack of sensors. In this way, the tracker will have as a set point the sun position at every second during the day for a period of five years. After sunset, the tracker goes back to the initial position (which of sunrise). The sliding mode control (SMC) will be applied to ensure at best the tracking mechanism and, in another hand, the sliding mode observer will replace the velocity sensor which suffers from a lot of measurement disturbances.

"We address the traffic light control problem for multiple intersections in tandem by viewing it as a stochastic hybrid system and developing a Stochastic Flow Model (SFM) for it. Using Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA), we derive on-line gradient estimates of a cost metric with respect to the controllable green and red cycle lengths. The IPA estimators obtained require counting traffic light switchings and estimating car flow rates only when specific events occur. The estimators are used to iteratively adjust light cycle lengths to improve performance and, in conjunction with a standard gradient-based algorithm, to obtain optimal values which adapt to changing traffic conditions. Simulation results are included to illustrate the approach.",1,Multi-intersection Traffic Light Control Using Infinitesimal  Perturbation Analysis
"This paper investigates vision-based cooperative estimation of a 3D target object pose for visual sensor networks. In our previous works, we presented an estimation mechanism called networked visual motion observer achieving averaging of local pose estimates in real time. This paper extends the mechanism so that it works even in the presence of cameras not viewing the target due to the limited view angles and obstructions in order to fully take advantage of the networked vision system. Then, we analyze the averaging performance attained by the proposed mechanism and clarify a relation between the feedback gains in the algorithm and the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm through simulation.",1,Vision-Based Cooperative Estimation of Averaged 3D Target Pose under  Imperfect Visibility
"This paper develops a controller synthesis method for distributed LQG control problems under output-feedback. We consider a system consisting of three interconnected linear subsystems with a delayed information sharing structure. While the state-feedback case has previously been solved, the extension to output-feedback is nontrivial as the classical separation principle fails. To find the optimal solution, the controller is decomposed into two independent components: a centralized LQG-optimal controller under delayed state observations, and a sum of correction terms based on additional local information available to decision makers. Explicit discrete-time equations are derived whose solutions are the gains of the optimal controller.",1,Distributed Output-Feedback LQG Control with Delayed Information Sharing
"High availability has always been one of the main problems for a data center. Till now high availability was achieved by host per host redundancy, a highly expensive method in terms of hardware and human costs. A new approach to the problem can be offered by virtualization. Using virtualization, it is possible to achieve a redundancy system for all the services running on a data center. This new approach to high availability allows the running virtual machines to be distributed over a small number of servers, by exploiting the features of the virtualization layer: start, stop and move virtual machines between physical hosts. The 3RC system is based on a finite state machine, providing the possibility to restart each virtual machine over any physical host, or reinstall it from scratch. A complete infrastructure has been developed to install operating system and middleware in a few minutes. To virtualize the main servers of a data center, a new procedure has been developed to migrate physical to virtual hosts. The whole Grid data center SNS-PISA is running at the moment in virtual environment under the high availability system.",1,High availability using virtualization - 3RC

"We define a special class of hybrid automata, called Deterministic and Transversal Linear Hybrid Automata (DTLHA), whose continuous dynamics in each location are linear time-invariant (LTI) with a constant input, and for which every discrete transition up to a given bounded time is deterministic and, importantly, transversal. For such a DTLHA starting from an initial state, we show that it is possible to compute an approximation of the reach set of a DTLHA over a finite time interval that is arbitrarily close to the exact reach set, called a bounded epsilon-reach set, through sampling and polyhedral over-approximation of sampled states. We propose an algorithm and an attendant architecture for the overall bounded epsilon-reach set computation process.",1,Bounded epsilon-Reach Set Computation of a Class of Deterministic and  Transversal Linear Hybrid Automata

"Information about the strength of gas sources in buildings has a number of applications in the area of building automation and control, including temperature and ventilation control, fire detection and security systems. Here, we consider the problem of estimating the strength of a gas source in an enclosure when some of the parameters of the gas transport process are unknown. Traditionally, these problems are either solved by the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) method which is accurate but computationally intense, or by Recursive Least Squares (RLS, also Kalman) filtering which is simpler but less accurate. In this paper, we suggest a different statistical estimation procedure based on the concept of Method of Moments. We outline techniques that make this procedure computationally efficient and amenable for recursive implementation. We provide a comparative analysis of our proposed method based on experimental results as well as Monte-Carlo simulations. When used with the building control systems, these algorithms can estimate the gaseous strength in a room both quickly and accurately, and can potentially provide improved indoor air quality in an efficient manner.",1,Accurate Estimation of Gaseous Strength using Transient Data
"We consider the problem of maximizing the algebraic connectivity of the communication graph in a network of mobile robots by moving them into appropriate positions. We define the Laplacian of the graph as dependent on the pairwise distance between the robots and we approximate the problem as a sequence of Semi-Definite Programs (SDP). We propose a distributed solution consisting of local SDP's which use information only from nearby neighboring robots. We show that the resulting distributed optimization framework leads to feasible subproblems and through its repeated execution, the algebraic connectivity increases monotonically. Moreover, we describe how to adjust the communication load of the robots based on locally computable measures.

"In this paper we present a decentralized algorithm to estimate the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix that encodes the network topology of a multi-agent system. We consider network topologies modeled by undirected graphs. The basic idea is to provide a local interaction rule among agents so that their state trajectory is a linear combination of sinusoids oscillating only at frequencies function of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. In this way, the problem of decentralized estimation of the eigenvalues is mapped into a standard signal processing problem in which the unknowns are the finite number of frequencies at which the signal oscillates.",1,Decentralized Estimation of Laplacian Eigenvalues in Multi-Agent Systems
"This paper describes the design and implementation of linear controllers with a switching condition for a nonlinear hot air blower system (HABS) process trainer PT326. The system is interfaced with a computer through a USB based data acquisition module and interfacing circuitry. A calibration equation is implemented through computer in order to convert the amplified output of the sensor to temperature. Overall plant is nonlinear; therefore, system identification is performed in three different regions depending upon the plant input. For these three regions, three linear controllers are designed with closed-loop system having small rise time, settling time and overshoot. Switching of controllers is based on regions defined by plant input. In order to avoid the effect of discontinuity, due to switching of linear controllers, parameters of all linear controllers are taken closer to each other. Finally, discretized controllers along with switching condition are implemented for the plant through computer and practical results are demonstrated.",1,Regional System Identification and Computer Based Switchable Control of  a Nonlinear Hot Air Blower System

The weight matrices used in the nuclear norm minimization are the same weights as used in standard subspace identification methods. We show that the inclusion of the weights improves the performance in terms of fit on validation data. As a second benefit, the weights reduce the size of the optimization problems that need to be solved. Experimental results from randomly generated examples as well as from the Daisy benchmark collection are reported. The key to an efficient implementation is the use of the alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem.",1,Subspace System Identification via Weighted Nuclear Norm Optimization
"In this paper, we study cooperative multi-agent systems in which the target objective and the controls exercised by the agents are dependent on the choices they made at initial system time. Such systems have been investigated in several recently published papers, mainly from the perspective of system analysis on issues such as control communication complexity, control energy cost and the feasibility of realization of target functions. This paper continues this line of research by developing optimal control design methodology for linear systems that are collaboratively manipulated by multiple agents based on their distributed choices. For target matrices that satisfy particular structural constraints, we derive control algorithms that can achieve the specified targets with minimum control cost. We compare state-feedback as well as open-loop control strategies for target realization and extend the optimality result to an arbitrary target matrix. The optimal control solutions are obtained by minimizing the average control cost subject to the set of specified target-state constraints by means of modern variation theory and the Lagrange multiplier method.",1,Cooperative Target Realization in Multi-Agent Systems Allowing  Choice-Based Actions
"Several design parameters in collective robotic systems have been investigated and developed in order to explore the cooperation among the autonomous robotic individuals in a variety of robotic swarms in the presence of different internal and external system constraints.

"A smart grid delivers power around the country and has an intelligent monitoring system, which not only keeps track of all the energy coming in from diverse sources but also can detect where energy is needed through a two-way communication system that collects data about how and when consumers use power. It is safer in many ways, compared with the current one-directional power supply system that seems susceptible to either sabotage or natural disasters, including being more resistant to attack and power outages. In such an autonomic and advanced-grid environment, investing in a pilot study and knowing the nation readiness to adopt a smart grid absolves the government of complex intervention from any failure to bring Japan into the autonomic-grid environment. This paper looks closely into the concept of the Japanese government go green effort, the objective of which is to make Japan a leading nation in environmental and energy sustainability through green innovation, such as creating a low-carbon society and embracing the natural grid community.

"In this paper we introduce the problem of dynamic pricing of power for smart-grid networks. This is studied within a network utility maximization (NUM) framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple users and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in a (deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge the users. The users then adjust their demand in response to the time-varying prices. This is typically categorized as the demand response problem, and we study a progression of related models by focusing on two aspects: 1) the characterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic prices in the Smart Grid and the optimal demand and supply under various interaction with a spot market; 2) a greedy approach to facilitate the solution process of the aggregate NUM problem and the optimality gap between the greedy solution and the optimal one.",1,Dynamic Pricing of Power in Smart-Grid Networks
"In this paper, a robust nonlinear control scheme is proposed for a nonlinear multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system subject to bounded time varying uncertainty which satisfies a certain integral quadratic constraint condition. The scheme develops a robust feedback linarization approach which uses standard feedback linearization approach to linearize the nominal nonlinear dynamics of the uncertain nonlinear system and linearizes the nonlinear time varying uncertainties at an arbitrary point using the mean value theorem. This approach transforms uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems into an equivalent MIMO linear uncertain system model with unstructured uncertainty. Finally, a robust minimax linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control design is proposed for the linearized model. The scheme guarantees the internal stability of the closed loop system and provides robust performance. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, the proposed method is applied to a tracking control problem for an air-breathing hypersonic flight vehicle (AHFV).",1,Minimax Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control of Nonlinear MIMO System with  Time Varying Uncertainties
"In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process. Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss - widely known as the price of anarchy - the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail. This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system.",1,Efficiency-Risk Tradeoffs in Dynamic Oligopoly Markets - with  application to electricity markets

"A straight forward application of feedback linearization to the missile autopilot design for acceleration control may be limited due to the nonminimum characteristics and the model uncertainties. As a remedy, this paper presents a cascade structure of an acceleration controller based on approximate feedback linearization methodology with a time-delay adaptation scheme. The inner loop controller is constructed by applying feedback linearization to the approximate system which is a minimum phase system and provides the desired acceleration signal caused by the angle-of-attack. This controller is augmented by the time-delay adaptive law and the outer loop PI (proportional-integral) controller in order to adaptively compensate for feedback linearization error because of model uncertainty and in order to track the desired acceleration signal. The performance of the proposed method is examined through numerical simulations. Moreover, the proposed controller is tested by using an intercept scenario in 6DOF nonlinear simulations.",1,Missile Acceleration Controller Design using PI and Time-Delay Adaptive  Feedback Linearization Methodology

"We employ supervisory controllers to safely coordinate high-level discrete(-event) behavior of distributed components of complex systems. Supervisory controllers observe discrete-event system behavior, make a decision on allowed activities, and communicate the control signals to the involved parties. Models of the supervisory controllers can be automatically synthesized based on formal models of the system components and a formalization of the safe coordination (control) requirements. Based on the obtained models, code generation can be used to implement the supervisory controllers in software, on a PLC, or an embedded (micro)processor. In this article, we develop a process theory with data that supports a model-based systems engineering framework for supervisory coordination. We employ communication to distinguish between the different flows of information, i.e., observation and supervision, whereas we employ data to specify the coordination requirements more compactly, and to increase the expressivity of the framework. To illustrate the framework, we remodel an industrial case study involving coordination of maintenance procedures of a printing process of a high-tech Oce printer.",1,Communicating Processes with Data for Supervisory Coordination

"Our goal is to achieve a high degree of fault tolerance through the control of a safety critical systems. This reduces to solving a game between a malicious environment that injects failures and a controller who tries to establish a correct behavior. We suggest a new control objective for such systems that offers a better balance between complexity and precision: we seek systems that are k-resilient. In order to be k-resilient, a system needs to be able to rapidly recover from a small number, up to k, of local faults infinitely many times, provided that blocks of up to k faults are separated by short recovery periods in which no fault occurs. k-resilience is a simple but powerful abstraction from the precise distribution of local faults, but much more refined than the traditional objective to maximize the number of local faults. We argue why we believe this to be the right level of abstraction for safety critical systems when local faults are few and far between. We show that the computational complexity of constructing optimal control with respect to resilience is low and demonstrate the feasibility through an implementation and experimental results.",1,Rapid Recovery for Systems with Scarce Faults

"Convenience and safeguarding our home appliances have become an important issue when dealing with an advancement and growth of an economy. This research focuses on the design and construction of a Dual Sensor heat-monitoring system. The circuit works by monitoring temperature from an external input and comparing the temperature level with that of a preset temperature value. The power output of the circuit is cut off or switched OFF or an alarm is triggered ON if the temperature of the external input is equal to or, greater than the preset temperature value. The methodology involves the application of linear precision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly proportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using temperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power supply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is switched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON when the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of the system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between the preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.

Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is an emerging learning paradigm for nonlinear regression problems and has shown its effectiveness in the machine learning community. An important feature of ELM is that the learning speed is extremely fast thanks to its random projection preprocessing step.

"Recovery of the initial state of a high-dimensional system can require a large number of measurements. In this paper, we explain how this burden can be significantly reduced when randomized measurement operators are employed. Our work builds upon recent results from Compressive Sensing (CS). In particular, we make the connection to CS analysis for random block diagonal matrices. By deriving Concentration of Measure (CoM) inequalities, we show that the observability matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) (a sufficient condition for stable recovery of sparse vectors) under certain conditions on the state transition matrix. For example, we show that if the state transition matrix is unitary, and if independent, randomly-populated measurement matrices are employed, then it is possible to uniquely recover a sparse high-dimensional initial state when the total number of measurements scales linearly in the sparsity level (the number of non-zero entries) of the initial state and logarithmically in the state dimension. We further extend our RIP analysis for scaled unitary and symmetric state transition matrices. We support our analysis with a case study of a two-dimensional diffusion process.",1,Technical Report: Observability with Random Observations

"This paper presents a new control, namely additive-state-decomposition dynamic inversion stabilized control, that is used to stabilize a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems subject to nonparametric time-varying uncertainties with respect to both state and input. By additive state decomposition and a new definition of output, the considered uncertain system is transformed into a minimum-phase uncertainty-free system with relative degree one, in which all uncertainties are lumped into a new disturbance at the output. Subsequently, dynamic inversion control is applied to reject the lumped disturbance. Performance analysis of the resulting closed-loop dynamics shows that the stability can be ensured. Finally, to demonstrate its effectiveness, the proposed control is applied to two existing problems by numerical simulation. Furthermore, in order to show its practicability, the proposed control is also performed on a real quadrotor to stabilize its attitude when its inertia moment matrix is subject to a large uncertainty.",1,Additive-State-Decomposition Dynamic Inversion Stabilized Control for a  Class of Uncertain MIMO Systems

It is based on a suboptimal method for computationally efficient trajectory generation based on continuous parameterization and linear programming. The torque controller optimizes a quadratic cost consisting of control error and machine losses in real-time respecting voltage and current limitations. The multivariable controller decouples the two current components and exploits cross-coupling effects in the long-range constrained predictive control strategy.

"Digital equipment such as computers, telecommunication systems and instruments use microprocessors that operate at high frequencies allowing them to carry out millions or even billions of operations per second. A disturbance in the electrical supply lasting just a few milliseconds can affect thousands or millions of basic operations. The result may be malfunctioning and loss of data with dangerous or costly consequences (e.g. loss of production). That is why many loads, called sensitive or critical loads, require a supply that is protected. Many manufacturers of sensitive equipment specify very strict tolerances, much stricter than those in the distribution system for the supply of their equipment, one example being Computer Business Equipment Manufacturers Association for computer equipment against distribution system disturbances. The design of this uninterrupted power supply (UPS) for personal computer (PC) is necessitated due to a need for enhanced portability in the design of personal computer desktop workstations. Apart from its original functionality as a backup source of power, this design incorporates the unit within the system unit casing, thereby reducing the number of system components available. Also, the embedding of this unit removes the untidiness of connecting wires and makes the whole computer act like a laptop. Not to be left out is the choice of a microcontroller as an important part of the circuitry. This has eliminated the weight and space-consuming components that make up an original design.

"The Anti Collision device is a detection device meant to be incorporated into cars for the purpose of safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The device is intended to find a way to implement a minimum spacing for cars in traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver. Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers.

The device works by sending out streams of infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle, both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared beams.

"It has been shown that max-plus linear systems are well suited for applications in synchronization and scheduling, such as the generation of train timetables, manufacturing, or traffic. In this paper we show that the same is true for multi-legged locomotion. In this framework, the max-plus eigenvalue of the system matrix represents the total cycle time, whereas the max-plus eigenvector dictates the steady-state behavior. Uniqueness of the eigenstructure also indicates uniqueness of the resulting behavior. For the particular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to two-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground, respectively). The generation of a gait (a manner of walking) for a multiple legged robot is then achieved by synchronizing the multiple discrete-event cycles via the max-plus framework. By construction, different gaits and gait parameters can be safely interleaved by using different system matrices. In this paper we address both the transient and steady-state behavior for a class of gaits by presenting closed-form expressions for the max-plus eigenvalue and max-plus eigenvector of the system matrix and the coupling time. The significance of this result is in showing guaranteed robustness to perturbations and gait switching, and also a systematic methodology for synthesizing controllers that allow for legged robots to change rhythms fast.",1,Synchronization of a class of cyclic discrete-event systems describing  legged locomotion
"We present a novel method called Kernel-SME filter for tracking multiple targets when the association of the measurements to the targets is unknown. The method is a further development of the Symmetric Measurement Equation (SME) filter, which removes the data association uncertainty of the original measurement equation with the help of a symmetric transformation. The underlying idea of the Kernel-SME filter is to construct a symmetric transformation by means of mapping the measurements to a Gaussian mixture. This transformation is scalable to a large number of targets and allows for deriving a Gaussian state estimator that has a cubic time complexity in the number of targets.",1,The Kernel-SME Filter for Multiple Target Tracking
The PID controller parameters can be adjusted in such a manner that it gives the desired frequency response and the results are found using the Bodes integral formula in order to adjust the slope of the nyquist curve in a desired manner. The same idea is applied for plants with time delay . The same has also been done in a new approach . The delay term is approximated as a transfer function using Pade approximation and then the Bode integral is used to determine the controller parameters. Both the methodologies are demonstrated with MATLAB simulation of representative plants and accompanying PID controllers. A proper comparison of the two methodologies is also done. The PID controller parameters are also tuned using a real coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a proper comparison is done between the three methods.,1,Stability Analysis Of Delayed System Using Bodes Integral
"Microgrid (MG) is a promising component for future smart grid (SG) deployment. The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the most important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel framework for smart energy management based on the concept of quality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident electricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic usage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled based on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the MG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e., QoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy resources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as a constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization technique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling algorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual queues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require any statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price processes. We derive several hard performance bounds for the proposed algorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity scheduling algorithm.",1,Adaptive Electricity Scheduling in Microgrids
"We analyze a distributed algorithm for estimation of scalar parameters belonging to nodes in a mobile network from noisy relative measurements. The motivation comes from the problem of clock skew and offset estimation for the purpose of time synchronization. The time variation of the network was modeled as a Markov chain. The estimates are shown to be mean square convergent under fairly weak assumptions on the Markov chain, as long as the union of the graphs is connected. Expressions for the asymptotic mean and correlation are also provided. The Markovian switching topology model of mobile networks is justified for certain node mobility models through empirically estimated conditional entropy measures.",1,Estimation from Relative Measurements in Mobile Networks with Markovian  Switching Topology: Clock Skew and Offset Estimation for Time Synchronization
We propose a new modeling paradigm for large dimensional aggregates of stochastic systems by Generalized Factor Analysis (GFA) models. These models describe the data as the sum of a flocking plus an uncorrelated idiosyncratic component. The flocking component describes a sort of collective orderly motion which admits a much simpler mathematical description than the whole ensemble while the idiosyncratic component describes weakly correlated noise. We first discuss static GFA representations and characterize in a rigorous way the properties of the two components. The extraction of the dynamic flocking component is discussed for time-stationary linear systems and for a simple classes of separable random fields.,1,Modeling complex systems by Generalized Factor Analysis
"The guidance of a torpedo represents a hard task because of the smooth nonlinear aspect of this system and because of the extreme external disturbances. The torpedo guidance reposes on the speed and the position control. In fact, the control approach which is very solicited for the electromechanical systems is the sliding mode control (SMC) which proved its effectiveness through the different studies. The SMC is robust versus disturbances and model uncertainties; however, a sharp discontinuous control is needed which induces the chattering phenomenon. The angular velocity measurement is a hard task because of the high level of disturbances. In this way, the sliding mode observer could be a solution for the velocity estimation instead of a sensor. This article deals with torpedo guidance by SMC to reach the desired path in a short time and with high precision quality. Simulation results show that this control strategy and observer can attain excellent control performances with no chattering problem.",1,A High-Order Sliding Mode Observer: Torpedo Guidance Application
This work deals with the design of a sliding mode observer with a multi-surfaces sliding mode multimodel control (SM-MMC) for a mechanical sensorless pumping system. The observer is designed to estimate the speed and the mechanical position of the DC motor operating in the process.

"Electricity peaks can be harmful to grid stability and result in additional generation costs to balance supply with demand. By developing a network of smart appliances together with a quasi-decentralized control protocol, direct load control (DLC) provides an opportunity to reduce peak consumption by directly controlling the on/off switch of the networked appliances. This paper proposes a packetized DLC (PDLC) solution that is illustrated by an application to air conditioning temperature control. Here the term packetized refers to a fixed time energy usage authorization. The consumers in each room choose their preferred set point, and then an operator of the local appliance pool will determine the comfort band around the set point. We use a thermal dynamic model to investigate the duty cycle of thermostatic appliances. Three theorems are proposed in this paper. The first two theorems evaluate the performance of the PDLC in both transient and steady state operation. The first theorem proves that the average room temperature would converge to the average room set point with fixed number of packets applied in each discrete interval. The second theorem proves that the PDLC solution guarantees to control the temperature of all the rooms within their individual comfort bands. The third theorem proposes an allocation method to link the results in theorem 1 and assumptions in theorem 2 such that the overall PDLC solution works. The direct result of the theorems is that we can reduce the consumption oscillation that occurs when no control is applied. Simulation is provided to verify theoretical results.",1,A Packetized Direct Load Control Mechanism for Demand Side Management
"Demand side management has gained increasing importance as the penetration of renewable energy grows. Based on a Markov jump process modelling of a group of thermostatic loads, this paper proposes a two level feedback system design between the independent system operator (ISO) and the regulation service provider such that two objectives are achieved: (1) the ISO can optimally dispatch regulation signals to multiple providers in real time in order to reduce the requirement for expensive spinning reserves, and (2) each regulation provider can control its thermostatic loads to respond the ISO signal. It is also shown that the amount of regulation service that can be provided is implicitly restricted by a few fundamental parameters of the provider itself, such as the allowable set point choice and its thermal constant. An interesting finding is that the regulation provider's ability to provide a large amount of long term accumulated regulation and short term signal tracking restrict each other. Simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the performance of the proposed framework.",1,A Two Level Feedback System Design to Regulation Service Provision
"This paper addresses a weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization problem for downlink OFDMA aided by a decode-and-forward (DF) relay under a total power constraint. A novel subcarrier-pair based opportunistic DF relaying protocol is proposed. Specifically, user message bits are transmitted in two time slots. A subcarrier in the first slot can be paired with a subcarrier in the second slot for the DF relay-aided transmission to a user. In particular, the source and the relay can transmit simultaneously to implement beamforming at the subcarrier in the second slot. Each unpaired subcarrier in either the first or second slot is used for the source's direct transmission to a user. A benchmark protocol, same as the proposed one except that the transmit beamforming is not used for the relay-aided transmission, is also considered. For each protocol, a polynomial-complexity algorithm is developed to find at least an approximately optimum resource allocation (RA), by using continuous relaxation, the dual method, and Hungarian algorithm. Instrumental to the algorithm design is an elegant definition of optimization variables, motivated by the idea of regarding the unpaired subcarriers as virtual subcarrier pairs in the direct transmission mode. The effectiveness of the RA algorithm and the impact of relay position and total power on the protocols' performance are illustrated by numerical experiments. The proposed protocol always leads to a maximum WSR equal to or greater than that for the benchmark one, and the performance gain of using the proposed one is significant especially when the relay is in close proximity to the source and the total power is low. Theoretical analysis is presented to interpret these observations.",1,Weighted Sum Rate Maximization for Downlink OFDMA with Subcarrier-pair  based Opportunistic DF Relaying
"In this paper we consider a linear system structured into physically coupled subsystems and propose a decentralized control scheme capable to guarantee asymptotic stability and satisfaction of constraints on system inputs and states. The design procedure is totally decentralized, since the synthesis of a local controller uses only information on a subsystem and its neighbors, i.e. subsystems coupled to it. We first derive tests for checking if a subsystem can be plugged into (or unplugged from) an existing plant without spoiling overall stability and constraint satisfaction. When this is possible, we show how to automatize the design of local controllers so that it can be carried out in parallel by smart actuators equipped with computational resources and capable to exchange information with neighboring subsystems. In particular, local controllers exploit tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) in order to guarantee robustness with respect to physical coupling among subsystems. Finally, an application of the proposed control design procedure to frequency control in power networks is presented.",1,Plug-and-Play Decentralized Model Predictive Control
"In this paper, we present an automated technique SWATI: Synthesizing Wordlengths Automatically Using Testing and Induction, which uses a combination of Nelder-Mead optimization based testing, and induction from examples to automatically synthesize optimal fixedpoint implementation of numerical routines. The design of numerical software is commonly done using floating-point arithmetic in design-environments such as Matlab. However, these designs are often implemented using fixed-point arithmetic for speed and efficiency reasons especially in embedded systems. The fixed-point implementation reduces implementation cost, provides better performance, and reduces power consumption. The conversion from floating-point designs to fixed-point code is subject to two opposing constraints: (i) the word-width of fixed-point types must be minimized, and (ii) the outputs of the fixed-point program must be accurate. In this paper, we propose a new solution to this problem. Our technique takes the floating-point program, specified accuracy and an implementation cost model and provides the fixed-point program with specified accuracy and optimal implementation cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a set of examples from the domain of automated control, robotics and digital signal processing.",1,SWATI: Synthesizing Wordlengths Automatically Using Testing and  Induction
"This paper investigates cooperative environmental monitoring for Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) visual sensor networks. We first present a novel formulation of the optimal environmental monitoring problem, whose objective function is intertwined with the uncertain state of the environment. In addition, due to the large volume of vision data, it is desired for each sensor to execute processing through local computation and communication. To address the issues, we present a distributed solution to the problem based on game theoretic cooperative control and payoff-based learning. At the first stage, a utility function is designed so that the resulting game constitutes a potential game with potential function equal to the group objective function, where the designed utility is shown to be computable through local image processing and communication. Then, we present a payoff-based learning algorithm so that the sensors are led to the global objective function maximizers without using any prior information on the environmental state. Finally, we run experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present approach.",1,Cooperative Environmental Monitoring for PTZ Visual Sensor Networks: A  Payoff-based Learning Approach
"In the scope of discrete finite-state models of interacting components, we present a novel algorithm for identifying sets of local states of components whose activity is necessary for the reachability of a given local state. If all the local states from such a set are disabled in the model, the concerned reachability is impossible. Those sets are referred to as cut sets and are computed from a particular abstract causality structure, so-called Graph of Local Causality, inspired from previous work and generalised here to finite automata networks. The extracted sets of local states form an under-approximation of the complete minimal cut sets of the dynamics: there may exist smaller or additional cut sets for the given reachability. Applied to qualitative models of biological systems, such cut sets provide potential therapeutic targets that are proven to prevent molecules of interest to become active, up to the correctness of the model. Our new method makes tractable the formal analysis of very large scale networks, as illustrated by the computation of cut sets within a Boolean model of biological pathways interactions gathering more than 9000 components.",1,Under-approximating Cut Sets for Reachability in Large Scale Automata  Networks
"Since the complexity of the practical environment, many distributed networked systems can not be illustrated with the integer-order dynamics and only be described as the fractional-order dynamics. Suppose multi-agent systems will show the individual diversity with difference agents, where the heterogeneous (integer-order and fractional-order) dynamics are used to illustrate the agent systems and compose integer-fractional compounded-order systems. Applying Laplace transform and frequency domain theory of the fractional-order operator, consensus of delayed multi-agent systems with directed weighted topologies is studied. Since integer-order model is the special case of fractional-order model, the results in this paper can be extend to the systems with integer-order models. Finally, numerical examples are used to verify our results.",1,Coordination Control of Heterogeneous Compounded-Order Multi-Agent  Systems with Communication Delays
"A general decentralized computational framework for set-valued state estimation and prediction for the class of systems that accept a hybrid state machine representation is considered in this article. The decentralized scheme consists of a conjunction of distributed state machines that are specified by a decomposition of the external signal space. While this is shown to produce, in general, outer approximations of the outcomes of the original monolithic state machine, here, specific rules for the signal space decomposition are devised by utilizing structural properties of the underyling transition relation, leading to a recovery of the exact state set results. By applying a suitable approximation algorithm, we show that computational complexity in the decentralized setting may thereby essentially reduce as compared to the centralized estimation scheme.",1,Decentralized set-valued state estimation based on non-deterministic  chains

The decentralized computational scheme represents a conj unction of a finite number of distributed state machines, which are specified by an appropriate decomposition of the external signal space. It aims at a distribution of computational tasks into smaller ones, allocated to individual distributed state machines, leading to a potentially significant reduction in the overall space/time computational complexity. We show that, in general, such a scheme outerapproximates the state set estimates and predictions of the original monolithic state machine. By utilizing structural properties of the transition relation of the latter, in a next step, we propose constructive decomposition algorithms for a recovery of the exact state set outcomes.",1,Decentralized set-valued state estimation and prediction for hybrid  systems: A symbolic approach
"Swarm robotic systems are mainly inspired by swarms of socials insects and the collective emergent behavior that arises from their cooperation at the lower lever. Despite the limited sensory ability, computational power, and communication means of each swarm member, the swarm as a group manages to achieve difficult tasks such as searching for food in terrains with obstacles that individual robots cannot achieve in isolation of the other group members. Moreover, such tasks are usually achieved without having information sharing capabilities at the swarm level or having a centralized decision making system. In this report, I survey the state of the field of applying adaptive control method to increase swarm robotic systems robustness to the failure of individual robots, and increase its efficiency in performing its task.

The problem of finding the set of all multi-model robust PID and three-term stabilizers for discrete-time systems is solved in this paper. The method uses the fact that decoupling of parameter space at singular frequencies is invariant under a linear transformation. The resulting stable regions are composed by convex polygonal slices. The design problem includes the assertion of intervals with stable polygons and the detection of stable polygons. This paper completes the solutions to both problems.,1,On computation of the total set of robust discrete-time PID controllers
"In this paper, we study the continuous-time consensus problem in the presence of adversaries. The networked multi-agent system is modeled as a switched system, where the normal agents have integrator dynamics and the switching signal determines the topology of the network. We consider several models of omniscient adversaries under the assumption that at most a fraction of any normal agent's neighbors may be adversaries. Under this fractional assumption on the interaction between normal and adversary agents, we show that a novel graph theoretic metric, called fractional robustness, is useful for analyzing the network topologies under which the normal agents achieve consensus.",1,Resilient Continuous-Time Consensus in Fractional Robust Networks
"This paper considers the leader-follower control problem for a linear multi-agent system with undirected topology and linear coupling subject to integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A consensus-type control protocol is proposed based on each agent's states relative its neighbors. In addition a selected set of agents uses for control their states relative the leader. Using a coordinate transformation, the consensus analysis of the multi-agent system is recast as a decentralized robust control problem for an auxiliary interconnected large scale system. Based on this interconnected large scale system, sufficient conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system tracks the leader. These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a simulation example.",1,Guaranteed Performance Leader-follower Control for Multi-agent Systems  with Linear IQC-Constrained Coupling
"The movements of birds, bats, and other flying species are governed by complex sensorimotor systems that allow the animals to react to stationary environmental features as well as to wind disturbances, other animals in nearby airspace, and a wide variety of unexpected challenges. The paper and talk will describe research that analyzes the three-dimensional trajectories of bats flying in a habitat in Texas. The trajectories are computed with stereoscopic methods using data from synchronous thermal videos that were recorded with high temporal and spatial resolution from three viewpoints. Following our previously reported work, we examine the possibility that bat trajectories in this habitat are governed by optical flow sensing that interpolates periodic distance measurements from echolocation. Using an idealized geometry of bat eyes, we introduce the concept of time-to-transit, and recall some research that suggests that this quantity is computed by the animals' visual cortex. Several steering control laws based on time-to-transit are proposed for an idealized flight model, and it is shown that these can be used to replicate the observed flight of what we identify as typical bats. Although the vision-based motion control laws we propose and the protocols for switching between them are quite simple, some of the trajectories that have been synthesized are qualitatively bat-like. Examination of the control protocols that generate these trajectories suggests that bat motions are governed both by their reactions to a subset of key feature points as well by their memories of where these feature points are located.",1,Optical Flow Sensing and the Inverse Perception Problem for Flying Bats

The objective is to find a minimum power excitation signal to be used in system identification experiment, such that the corresponding model-based feed-forward controller guarantees, with a given probability, that the variance of the output signal is within given specifications. To start with, some low order model problems are analytically solved and fundamental properties of the optimal input signal solution are presented. The optimal input signal contains feed-forward control and depends of the noise model and transfer function of the system in a specific way. Next, we show how to apply the partial correlation approach to closed loop optimal experiment design to the general feed-forward problem. A framework for optimal input signal design for feed-forward control is presented and numerically evaluated on a temperature control problem.",1,On Optimal Input Design for Feed-forward Control
"Non-linear controller is preferred to linear controller due to non-linear operation of DSTATCOM. System dynamic can be improved by regulating and fixing the capacitor DC voltage in DSTATCOM. The nonlinear control is based on exact linearization via feedback. There is a PI controller in this system to regulate DC voltage. In conventional scheme, the trial and error method is used to determine PI values. Exact calculation to optimize PI coefficients can be carried out to reduce disturbances in DC link voltage and thus, in this paper, Particle Swarm Optimization is applied. As a result, Capacitor voltage tracks the reference values which have less vibration than conventional status. Both trial and error method and PSO are implemented.

In this contribution, we are concerned with the task of identifying an ARX model from only output measurements. Driven by the task of identifying systems that are turned on and off at unknown times, we seek a piecewise constant input and a corresponding ARX model which approximates the measured outputs. We phrase this as a rank minimization problem and present a relaxed convex formulation to approximate its solution.

The deformed Laplacian is a second-degree matrix polynomial in the real variable 's' which reduces to the standard Laplacian for 's' equal to unity. The stability properties of the ensuing deformed consensus protocol are studied in terms of parameter 's' for some special families of undirected and directed graphs, and for arbitrary graph topologies by leveraging the spectral theory of quadratic eigenvalue problems.

The approach is applied to London's Barclays Cycle Hire scheme, which the authors have simulated based on historical data. Using model-based predictive control principles, dynamically varying rewards are computed and offered to customers carrying out journeys. The aim is to encourage them to park bicycles at nearby under-used stations, thereby reducing the expected cost of repositioning them using dedicated staff. In parallel, the routes that repositioning staff should take are periodically recomputed using a model-based heuristic. It is shown that a trade-off between reward payouts to customers and the cost of hiring repositioning staff could be made, in order to minimize operating costs for a given desired service level.",1,Dynamic vehicle redistribution and online price incentives in shared  mobility systems
"Consensus problem of high-order integral multi-agent systems under switching directed topology is considered in this study. Depending on whether the agent's full state is available or not, two distributed protocols are proposed to ensure that states of all agents can be convergent to a same stationary value. In the proposed protocols, the gain vector associated with the agent's (estimated) state and the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated) states between agents are designed in a sophisticated way. By this particular design, the high-order integral multi-agent system can be transformed into a first-order integral multi-agent system. And the convergence of the transformed first-order integral agent's state indicates the convergence of the original high-order integral agent's state if and only if all roots of the polynomial, whose coefficients are the entries of the gain vector associated with the relative (estimated) states between agents, are in the open left-half complex plane. Therefore, many analysis techniques in the first-order integral multi-agent system can be directly borrowed to solve the problems in the high-order integral multi-agent system. Due to this property, it is proved that to reach a consensus, the switching directed topology of multi-agent system is only required to be uniformly jointly quasi-strongly connected, which seems the mildest connectivity condition in the literature. In addition, the consensus problem of discrete-time high-order integral multi-agent systems is studied. The corresponding consensus protocol and performance analysis are presented. Finally, three simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",1,Reaching a Consensus in Networks of High-Order Integral Agents under  Switching Directed Topology
"In this paper, we study the problem of formation keeping of a network of strictly passive systems when very coarse information is exchanged. We assume that neighboring agents only know whether their relative position is larger or smaller than the prescribed one. This assumption results in very simple control laws that direct the agents closer or away from each other and take values in finite sets. We show that the task of formation keeping while tracking a desired trajectory and rejecting matched disturbances is still achievable under the very coarse information scenario. In contrast with other results of practical convergence with coarse or quantized information, here the control task is achieved exactly.",1,Formation control with binary information

Specific estimators are derived for elliptic and star-convex shapes.",1,Extended Object Tracking with Random Hypersurface Models
"The standard engineering approach to modelling of complex systems is highly compositional. In order to be able to understand (or to control) the behavior of a complex dynamical systems, it is often desirable, if not necessary, to view this system as an interconnection of smaller interacting subsystems, each of these subsystems having its own functionalities. In this paper, we propose a compositional approach to the computation of bisimulation functions for dynamical systems. Bisimulation functions are quantitative generalizations of the classical bisimulation relations. They have been shown useful for simulation-based verification or for the computation of approximate symbolic abstractions of dynamical systems. In this technical note, we present a constructive result for the composition of bisimulation functions. For a complex dynamical system consisting of several interconnected subsystems, it allows us to compute a bisimulation function from the knowledge of a bisimulation function for each of the subsystem.",1,A composition theorem for bisimulation functions

"Runway incursions are among the most serious safety concerns in air traffic control. Traditional A-SMGCS level 2 safety systems detect runway incursions with the help of surveillance information only. In the context of SESAR, complementary safety systems are emerging that also use other information in addition to surveillance, and that aim at warning about potential runway incursions at earlier points in time. One such system is conflicting ATC clearances, which processes the clearances entered by the air traffic controller into an electronic flight strips system and cross-checks them for potentially dangerous inconsistencies. The cross-checking logic may be implemented directly based on the clearances and on surveillance data, but this is cumbersome. We present an approach that instead uses ground routes as an intermediate layer, thereby simplifying the core safety logic.",1,Route-Based Detection of Conflicting ATC Clearances on Airports

The model is based on classification of tasks with similar energy consumption characteristics into a finite number of clusters. The aggregator responsible for scheduling the charge of the vehicles has two goals: 1) to provide a hard QoS guarantee to the vehicles at the lowest possible cost; 2) to offer load or generation following services to the wholesale market. In order to achieve these goals, we combine the scalable demand model we propose with two scheduling mechanisms, a near-optimal and a heuristic technique. The performance of the two mechanisms is compared under a realistic setting in our numerical experiments.",1,Clustering Consumption in Queues: A Scalable Model for Electric Vehicle  Scheduling
"In this thesis, the synthesis of correct-by-construction controllers for robots assisting in Search and Rescue (SAR) is considered. In recent years, the development of robots assisting in disaster mitigation in urban environments has been actively encouraged, since robots can be deployed in dangerous and hazardous areas where human SAR operations would not be possible.  In order to meet the reliability requirements in SAR, the specifications of the robots are stated in Linear Temporal Logic and synthesized into finite state machines that can be executed as controllers. The resulting controllers are purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment by changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from sensors or other robots.  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks, the synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered. This distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be solved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in order to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular, communication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified standardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and moving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and robbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so that the number of robots required is minimized.  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for robots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for moving targets. It is shown that the controllers are guaranteed to achieve the common goal of finding and rescuing the targets.",1,Automated Synthesis of Controllers for Search and Rescue from Temporal  Logic Specifications
"This paper deals with the error analysis of a novel navigation algorithm that uses as input the sequence of images acquired from a moving camera and a Digital Terrain (or Elevation) Map (DTM/DEM). More specifically, it has been shown that the optical flow derived from two consecutive camera frames can be used in combination with a DTM to estimate the position, orientation and ego-motion parameters of the moving camera. As opposed to previous works, the proposed approach does not require an intermediate explicit reconstruction of the 3D world. In the present work the sensitivity of the algorithm outlined above is studied. The main sources for errors are identified to be the optical-flow evaluation and computation, the quality of the information about the terrain, the structure of the observed terrain and the trajectory of the camera. By assuming appropriate characterization of these error sources, a closed form expression for the uncertainty of the pose and motion of the camera is first developed and then the influence of these factors is confirmed using extensive numerical simulations. The main conclusion of this paper is to establish that the proposed navigation algorithm generates accurate estimates for reasonable scenarios and error sources, and thus can be effectively used as part of a navigation system of autonomous vehicles.",1,Correction of inertial navigation system's errors by the help of  video-based navigator based on Digital Terrarium Map

"We identify a new observability concept, called relative observability, in supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial observation. A fixed, ambient language is given, relative to which observability is tested. Relative observability is stronger than observability, but enjoys the important property that it is preserved under set union; hence there exists the supremal relatively observable sublanguage of a given language. Relative observability is weaker than normality, and thus yields, when combined with controllability, a generally larger controlled behavior; in particular, no constraint is imposed that only observable controllable events may be disabled. We design algorithms which compute the supremal relatively observable (and controllable) sublanguage of a given language, which is generally larger than the normal counterparts. We demonstrate the new observability concept and algorithms with a Guideway and an AGV example.",1,Relative Observability of Discrete-Event Systems and its Supremal  Sublanguages
"The paper is devoted to the approximate consensus problem for networks of nonlinear agents with switching topology, noisy and delayed measurements. In contrast to the existing stochastic approximation-based control algorithms (protocols), a local voting protocol with nonvanishing step size is proposed. Nonvanishing (e.g., constant) step size protocols give the opportunity to achieve better convergence rate (by choosing proper step sizes) in coping with time-varying loads and agent states. The price to pay is replacement of the mean square convergence with an approximate one. To analyze dynamics of the closed loop system, the so-called method of averaged models is used. It allows to reduce analysis complexity of the closed loop system. In this paper the upper bounds for mean square distance between the initial system and its approximate averaged model are proposed. The proposed upper bounds are used to obtain conditions for approximate consensus achievement.  The method is applied to the load balancing problem in stochastic dynamic networks with incomplete information about the current states of agents and with changing set of communication links. The load balancing problem is formulated as consensus problem in noisy model with switched topology. The conditions to achieve the optimal level of load balancing (in the sense that if no new task arrives, all agents will finish at the same time) are obtained.  The performance of the system is evaluated analytically and by simulation. It is shown that the performance of the adaptive multi-agent strategy with the redistribution of tasks among connected neighbors is significantly better than the performance without redistribution. The obtained results are important for control of production networks, multiprocessor, sensor or multicomputer networks, etc.",1,Approximate Consensus Multi-Agent Control Under Stochastic Environment  with Application to Load Balancing
"In fact, information systems are the foundation of new productivity sources, medical organizational forms, and erection of a global economy. IoT based healthcare systems play a significant role in ICT and have contribution in growth of medical information systems, which are underpinning of recent medical and economic development strategies. However, to take advantages of IoT, it is essential that medical enterprises and community should trust the IoT systems in terms of performance, security, privacy, reliability and return-on-investment, which are open challenges of current IoT systems. For heightening of healthcare system; tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients and medical objects are more essential. But due to the inadequate healthcare situation, medical environment, medical technologies and the unique requirements of some healthcare applications, the obtainable tools cannot meet them accurately. The tracking, tracing and monitoring of patients and healthcare actors activities in healthcare system are challenging research directions for IoT researchers.

"Timely recognition of voltage instability is crucial to allow for effective control and protection interventions. Phasor measurements units (PMUs) can be utilized to provide high sampling rate time-synchronized voltage and current phasors suitable for wide-area voltage instability detection. However, PMU data contains unwanted measurement errors and noise, which may affect the results of applications using these measurements for voltage instability detection. The aim of this article is to revisit a sensitivities calculation to detect voltage instability by applying a method utilizing linear regression for preprocessing PMU data. The methodology is validated using both real-time hardware-in-the-loop simulation and real PMU measurements from Norwegian network.",1,PMU-based Voltage Instability Detection through Linear Regression
"In a leader-follower multi-agent system (MAS), the leader agents act as control inputs and influence the states of the remaining follower agents. The rate at which the follower agents converge to their desired states, as well as the errors in the follower agent states prior to convergence, are determined by the choice of leader agents. In this paper, we study leader selection in order to minimize convergence errors experienced by the follower agents, which we define as a norm of the distance between the follower agents' intermediate states and the convex hull of the leader agent states. By introducing a novel connection to random walks on the network graph, we show that the convergence error has an inherent supermodular structure as a function of the leader set. Supermodularity enables development of efficient discrete optimization algorithms that directly approximate the optimal leader set, provide provable performance guarantees, and do not rely on continuous relaxations. We formulate two leader selection problems within the supermodular optimization framework, namely, the problem of selecting a fixed number of leader agents in order to minimize the convergence error, as well as the problem of selecting the minimum-size set of leader agents to achieve a given bound on the convergence error. We introduce algorithms for approximating the optimal solution to both problems in static networks, dynamic networks with known topology distributions, and dynamic networks with unknown and unpredictable topology distributions. Our approach is shown to provide significantly lower convergence errors than existing random and degree-based leader selection methods in a numerical study.",1,Minimizing Convergence Error in Multi-Agent Systems via Leader  Selection: A Supermodular Optimization Approach
"In this note, the distributed consensus corrupted by relative-state-dependent measurement noises is considered. Each agent can measure or receive its neighbors' state information with random noises, whose intensity is a vector function of agents' relative states. By investigating the structure of this interaction and the tools of stochastic differential equations, we develop several small consensus gain theorems to give sufficient conditions in terms of the control gain, the number of agents and the noise intensity function to ensure mean square (m. s.) and almost sure (a. s.) consensus and quantify the convergence rate and the steady-state error. Especially, for the case with homogeneous communication and control channels, a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure m. s. consensus on the control gain is given and it is shown that the control gain is independent of the specific network topology, but only depends on the number of nodes and the noise coefficient constant. For symmetric measurement models, the almost sure convergence rate is estimated by the Iterated Logarithm Law of Brownian motions.",1,Multi-Agent Consensus With Relative-State-Dependent Measurement Noises
"This paper presents a new algorithm for personal identification from their Electrocardiograms (ECG) which is based on morphological descriptors and Hermite Polynomials Expansion coefficients (HPEc). After preprocessing, we extracted ten morphological descriptors which were divided into homogeneous groups (amplitude, surface interval and slope) and we extracted sixty Hermite Polynomials Expansion coefficients(HPEc) from each heartbeat. For the classification, we employed a binary Support Vector Machines with Gaussian kernel and we adopted a particular strategy: we first classified groups of morphological descriptors separately then we combined them in one system. On the other hand, we classified the Hermite Polynomials Expansion coefficients apart and we associated them with all groups of morphological descriptors in a single system in order to improve overall performance. We tested our algorithm on 18 different healthy signals of the MIT_BIH database. The analysis of different groups separately showed that the best recognition performance is 96.45% for all morphological descriptors and the results of experiments showed that the proposed hybrid approach has led to an overall maximum of 98.97%.",1,SVM based on personal identification system using Electrocardiograms
"In the recent past, wireless controlled vehicles had been extensively used in a lot of areas like unmanned rescue missions, military usage for unmanned combat and many others. But the major disadvantage of these wireless unmanned robots is that they typically make use of RF circuits for maneuver and control. Essentially RF circuits suffer from a lot of drawbacks such as limited frequency range i.e. working range, and limited control. To overcome such problems associated with RF control, few papers have been written, describing methods which make use of the GSM network and the DTMF function of a cell phone to control the robotic vehicle. This paper although uses the same principle technology of the GSM network and the DTMF based mobile phone but it essentially shows the construction of a circuit using only 4 bits of wireless data communication to control the motion of the vehicle without the use of any microcontroller. This improvement results in considerable reduction of circuit complexity and of manpower for software development as the circuit built using this system does not require any form of programming. Moreover, practical results obtained showed an appreciable degree of accuracy of the system and friendliness without the use of any microcontroller.",1,Design and Implementation of an Unmanned Vehicle using a GSM Network  without Microcontrollers

"Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. Its essence is the decomposition of monolithic (global) control action into local control strategies for the individual agents. In this paper, we establish a counterpart supervisor localization theory in the framework of State Tree Structures, known to be efficient for control design of very large systems. In the new framework, we introduce the new concepts of local state tracker, local control function, and state-based local-global control equivalence. As before, we prove that the collective localized control behavior is identical to the monolithic optimal (i.e. maximally permissive) and nonblocking controlled behavior. In addition, we propose a new and more efficient localization algorithm which exploits BDD computation. Finally we demonstrate our localization approach on a model for a complex semiconductor manufacturing system.",1,Supervisor Localization of Discrete-Event Systems based on State Tree  Structures

"Now-a-days, a lot of research is being carried out in the development of USVs (Unmanned surface vehicles), UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) etc. Now in case of USVs generally, we have seen that wireless controlled vehicles use RF circuits which suffer from many drawbacks such as limited working range, limited frequency range and limited control. Moreover shooting infrared outdoors on a bright sunny day is often problematic, since sunlight can interfere with the infrared signal. Use of a GSM network (in the form of a mobile phone, a cordless phone) for robotic control can overcome these limitations. It provides the advantages of robust control, working range as large as the coverage area of the service provider in comparison with that of an IR system, no interference with other controllers.

"Target tracking using observations from multiple sensors can achieve better estimation performance than a single sensor. The most famous estimation tool in target tracking is Kalman filter. There are several mathematical approaches to combine the observations of multiple sensors by use of Kalman filter. An important issue in applying a proper approach is computational complexity. In this paper, four data fusion algorithms based on Kalman filter are considered including three centralized and one decentralized methods. Using MATLAB, computational loads of these methods are compared while number of sensors increases. The results show that inverse covariance method has the best computational performance if the number of sensors is above 20.

The design of a power buffer to mitigate the negative impact of constant power loads on voltage stability as well as enhancing ride-through capability for the loads during upstream voltage disturbances is examined. The power buffer adjusts its front-end converter control so that the buffer-load combination would appear as a constant impedance load to the upstream supply system when depressed voltage occurs. A battery energy-storage back-up source within the buffer is activated to maintain the load power demand. It is shown that the buffer performance is affected by the battery state of discharge and discharge current. Analytical expressions are also derived to relate the buffer-load ride-through capability with the battery state-of-discharge. The most onerous buffer-battery condition under which the load-ride through can be achieved has been identified.,1,Energy Storage System Design for a Power Buffer System to Provide Load  Ride-through

We consider approximating distributions within the framework of optimal mass transport and specialize to the problem of clustering data sets. Distances between distributions are measured in the Wasserstein metric. The main problem we consider is that of approximating sample distributions by ones with sparse support. This provides a new viewpoint to clustering. We propose different relaxations of a cardinality function which penalizes the size of the support set. We establish that a certain relaxation provides the tightest convex lower approximation to the cardinality penalty. We compare the performance of alternative relaxations on a numerical study on clustering.,1,Convex Clustering via Optimal Mass Transport
"In this paper a novel distributed algorithm for blind macro calibration in sensor networks based on output synchronization is proposed. The algorithm is formulated as a set of gradient-type recursions for estimating parameters of sensor calibration functions, starting from local criteria defined as weighted sums of mean square differences between the outputs of neighboring sensors. It is proved, on the basis of an originally developed methodology for treating higher-order consensus (or output synchronization) schemes, that the algorithm achieves asymptotic agreement for sensor gains and offsets, in the mean square sense and with probability one. In the case of additive measurement noise, additive inter-agent communication noise, and communication outages, a modification of the original algorithm based on instrumental variables is proposed. It is proved using stochastic approximation arguments that the modified algorithm achieves asymptotic consensus for sensor gains and offsets, in the mean square sense and with probability one. Special attention is paid to the situation when a subset of sensors in the network remains with fixed characteristics. Illustrative simulation examples are provided.",1,Distributed Blind Calibration via Output Synchronization in Lossy Sensor  Networks

A sufficient condition is obtained by overbounding the cost function. Based on this sufficient condition, a computational algorithm is introduced to minimize the proposed guaranteed bound on tracking performance, which yields a suboptimal bound on the system consensus control and tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a simulation example.",1,Guaranteed Cost Tracking for Uncertain Coupled Multi-agent Systems Using  Consensus over a Directed Graph
"Recent work on complex networks compared the topological and electrical structures of the power grid, taking into account the underlying physical laws that govern the electrical connectivity between various components in the network. A distance metric, namely, resistance distance was introduced to provide a more comprehensive description of interconnections in power systems compared with the topological structure, which is based only on geographic connections between network components. Motivated by these studies, in this paper we revisit the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem by deriving the connectivity matrix of the network using resistance distances between buses in the grid, and use it in the integer program formulations for several standard IEEE bus systems. The main result of this paper is rather discouraging: more number of PMUs are required, compared with those obtained using the topological structure, to meet the desired objective of complete network observability without zero injection measurements. However, in light of recent advances in the electrical structure of the grid, our study provides a more realistic perspective of PMU placement in power systems. By further exploring the connectivity matrix derived using the electrical structure, we devise a procedure to solve the placement problem without resorting to linear programming.",1,Electrical Structure-Based PMU Placement in Electric Power Systems
"Algorithms and dynamics over networks often involve randomization, and randomization may result in oscillating dynamics which fail to converge in a deterministic sense. In this paper, we observe this undesired feature in three applications, in which the dynamics is the randomized asynchronous counterpart of a well-behaved synchronous one. These three applications are network localization, PageRank computation, and opinion dynamics. Motivated by their formal similarity, we show the following general fact, under the assumptions of independence across time and linearities of the updates: if the expected dynamics is stable and converges to the same limit of the original synchronous dynamics, then the oscillations are ergodic and the desired limit can be locally recovered via time-averaging.",1,Ergodic Randomized Algorithms and Dynamics over Networks
"Among the intelligent safety technologies for road vehicles, active suspensions controlled by embedded computing elements for preventing rollover have received a lot of attention. The existing models for synthesizing and allocating forces in such suspensions are conservatively based on the constraint that no wheels lift off the ground. However, in practice, smart/active suspensions are more necessary in the situation where the wheels have just lifted off the ground. The difficulty in computing control in the last situation is that the problem requires satisfying disjunctive constraints on the dynamics. To the authors',knowledge, no efficient solution method is available for the simulation of dynamics with disjunctive constraints and thus hardware realizable and accurate force allocation in an active suspension tends to be a difficulty. In this work we give an algorithm for and simulate numerical solutions of the force allocation problem as an optimal control problem constrained by dynamics with disjunctive constraints. In particular we study the allocation and synthesis of time-dependent active suspension forces in terms of sensor output data in order to stabilize the roll motion of the road vehicle. An equivalent constraint in the form of a convex combination (hull) is proposed to satisfy the disjunctive constraints. The validated numerical simulations show that it is possible to allocate and synthesize control forces at the active suspensions from sensor output data such that the forces stabilize the roll moment of the vehicle with its wheels just lifted off the ground during arbitrary fish-hook maneuvers.",1,Rollover Preventive Force Synthesis at Active Suspensions in a Vehicle  Performing a Severe Maneuver with Wheels Lifted off
"This paper presents the design and analysis of a compensation method with application to a 345 kV 480 MVA three-phase transmission line. The compensator system includes a series injected voltage source converter that minimizes the resonance effects of capacitor line reactance. This creates an ability to compensate for the effects of subsynchronous resonance and thereby increase line loadability and control real and reactive power flows. The granularity of power flow control and simultaneous stabilization is achieved by the method of direct decoupled power control (DPC). The design process is detailed with respect to optimal response characteristics considering variations of line parameters, realistic transformer impedances, and maximum ramp response rates. Line effects are demonstrated in a PLECS model in MATLAB, and compensation control system functionality is verified.

The frequency droop response of conventional turbine driven synchronous generators with respect to load increases is normally used in order to have stable operating characteristics for multiple generators operating in parallel over large geographical regions. This presents a challenge for renewable energy sources that interface to the transmission grid through static inverters that do not exhibit an intrinsic frequency droop characteristic. This paper provides a technique for designing optimal load frequency controllers as transmission line inverters fed from renewable energy sources that allows for fast dynamic response due to variable solar and wind conditions while maintain stability to interconnected synchronous generators.

"In this paper we study a transmission power tune problem with densely deployed 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). While previous papers emphasize on tuning transmission power with either PHY or MAC layer separately, optimally setting each Access Point's (AP's) transmission power of a densely deployed 802.11 network considering its dual effects on both layers remains an open problem. In this work, we design a measure by evaluating impacts of transmission power on network performance on both PHY and MAC layers. We show that such an optimization problem is intractable and then we investigate and develop an analytical framework to allow simple yet efficient solutions. Through simulations and numerical results, we observe clear benefits of the dual-effect model compared to solutions optimizing solely on a single layer; therefore, we conclude that tuning transmission power from a dual layer (PHY-MAC) point of view is essential and necessary for dense WLANs. We further form a game theoretical framework and investigate above power-tune problem in a strategic network. We show that with decentralized and strategic users, the Nash Equilibrium (N.E.) of the corresponding game is in-efficient and thereafter we propose a punishment based mechanism to enforce users to adopt the social optimal strategy profile under both perfect and imperfect sensing environments.",1,Revisiting Optimal Power Control: its Dual Effect on SNR and Contention

We consider a system consisting of three interconnected linear subsystems with a delayed information sharing structure. While the state-feedback case of this problem has previously been solved, the extension to output-feedback is nontrivial, as the classical separation principle fails. To find the optimal solution, the controller is decomposed into two independent components. One is delayed centralized LQR, and the other is the sum of correction terms based on additional local information. Explicit discrete-time equations are derived whose solutions are the gains of the optimal controller.",1,Optimal Distributed Controller Design with Communication Delays:  Application to Vehicle Formations
"We propose a decentralized subspace algorithm for identification of large-scale, interconnected systems that are described by sparse (multi) banded state-space matrices. First, we prove that the state of a local subsystem can be approximated by a linear combination of inputs and outputs of the local subsystems that are in its neighborhood. Furthermore, we prove that for interconnected systems with well-conditioned, finite-time observability Gramians (or observability matrices), the size of this neighborhood is relatively small. On the basis of these results, we develop a subspace identification algorithm that identifies a state-space model of a local subsystem from the local input-output data. Consequently, the developed algorithm is computationally feasible for interconnected systems with a large number of local subsystems. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the new identification algorithm.",1,Subspace identification of large-scale interconnected systems

The first one is technical, namely we formulate the coverage problem as an optimization problem on SO(3) without introducing local parameterization like Eular angles and directly apply the gradient descent algorithm on the manifold. The second technological contribution is to present not only the coverage control scheme but also the density estimation process including image processing and curve fitting while exemplifying its effectiveness through simulation of moving objects monitoring.",1,3-D Visual Coverage Based on Gradient Descent Techniques on Matrix  Manifold and Its Application to Moving Objects Monitoring
"The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous work demonstrates that the so-called back-pressure control provides stability guarantees, assuming infinite queues capacities. In this paper, we highlight the failing of current back-pressure control under finite capacities by identifying sources of non work-conservation and congestion propagation. We propose the use of a normalized pressure which guarantees work conservation and mitigates congestion propagation, while ensuring fairness at low traffic densities, and recovering original back-pressure as capacities grow to infinity. This capacity-aware back-pressure control allows to improve performance as congestion increases, as indicated by simulation results, and keeps the key benefits of back-pressure: ability to be distributed over intersections and O(1) complexity.",1,Capacity-aware back-pressure traffic signal control
"Many systems for which compressive sensing is used today are dynamical. The common approach is to neglect the dynamics and see the problem as a sequence of independent problems. This approach has two disadvantages. Firstly, the temporal dependency in the state could be used to improve the accuracy of the state estimates. Secondly, having an estimate for the state and its support could be used to reduce the computational load of the subsequent step. In the linear Gaussian setting, compressive sensing was recently combined with the Kalman filter to mitigate above disadvantages. In the nonlinear dynamical case, compressive sensing can not be used and, if the state dimension is high, the particle filter would perform poorly. In this paper we combine one of the most novel developments in compressive sensing, nonlinear compressive sensing, with the particle filter. We show that the marriage of the two is essential and that neither the particle filter or nonlinear compressive sensing alone gives a satisfying solution.",1,Nonlinear Compressive Particle Filtering
"Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is used to activate the dysfunctional lower limb muscles of individuals with neuromuscular disorders to produce cycling as a means of exercise and rehabilitation. However, FES-cycling is still metabolically inefficient and yields low power output at the cycle crank compared to able-bodied cycling. Previous literature suggests that these problems are symptomatic of poor muscle control and non-physiological muscle fiber recruitment. The latter is a known problem with FES in general, and the former motivates investigation of better control methods for FES-cycling.In this paper, a stimulation pattern for quadriceps femoris-only FES-cycling is derived based on the effectiveness of knee joint torque in producing forward pedaling. In addition, a switched sliding-mode controller is designed for the uncertain, nonlinear cycle-rider system with autonomous state-dependent switching. The switched controller yields ultimately bounded tracking of a desired trajectory in the presence of an unknown, time-varying, bounded disturbance, provided a reverse dwell-time condition is satisfied by appropriate choice of the control gains and a sufficient desired cadence. Stability is derived through Lyapunov methods for switched systems, and experimental results demonstrate the performance of the switched control system under typical cycling conditions.",1,Stationary Cycling Induced by Switched Functional Electrical Stimulation  Control

Assuming that the fast variables are infinitely fast and are stable in the long-term, the QSS model replaces the differential equations of transient dynamics by their equilibrium equations to reduce complexity and increase computation efficiency. Although the idea of QSS model is intuitive, its theoretical foundation has not yet been developed.

Customers have different interpretations of the level of risk associated with committing to pass over the control over the consumption schedule of their devices to an operator, and these risk levels are only privately known. The operator maximizes his expected profit of operating the DLS program by posting the right participation incentives for different appliance types, in a publicly available and dynamically updated table. Customers are then faced with the dynamic decision making problem of whether to take the incentives and participate or not. We define an optimization framework to determine the profit-maximizing incentives for the operator. In doing so, we also investigate the utility that the operator expects to gain from recruiting different types of devices. These utilities also provide an upper-bound on the benefits that can be attained from any type of demand response program.",1,Incentive Design for Direct Load Control Programs
"We consider an exponentially stable closed loop interconnection of a continuous linear plant and a continuous linear controller, and we study the problem of interconnecting the plant output to the controller input through a digital channel. We propose a family of transmission-lazy sensors whose goal is to transmit the measured plant output information as little as possible while preserving closed-loop stability. In particular, we propose two transmission policies, providing conditions on the transmission parameters. These guarantee global asymptotic stability when the plant state is available or when an estimate of the state is available (provided by a classical continuous linear observer). Moreover, under a specific condition, they guarantee global exponential stability",1,Event-triggered transmission for linear control over communication  channels
"Recently it has been shown that an aggregation of Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) can be utilized to provide fast regulating reserve service for power grids and the behavior of the aggregation can be captured by a stochastic battery with dissipation. In this paper, we address two practical issues associated with the proposed battery model. First, we address clustering of a heterogeneous collection and show that by finding the optimal dissipation parameter for a given collection, one can divide these units into few clusters and improve the overall battery model. Second, we analytically characterize the impact of imposing a no-short-cycling requirement on TCLs as constraints on the ramping rate of the regulation signal. We support our theorems by providing simulation results.",1,Improved Battery Models of an Aggregation of Thermostatically Controlled  Loads for Frequency Regulation
"This paper proposes a correction method, which corrects the actual compressor performance in real operating conditions to the equivalent performance under specified reference condition. The purpose is to make fair comparisons between actual performance against design performance or reference maps under the same operating conditions. Then the abnormal operating conditions or early failure indications can be identified through condition monitoring, which helps to avoid mandatory shutdown and reduces maintenance costs. The corrections are based on an iterative scheme, which simultaneously correct the main performance parameters known as the polytropic head, the gas power, and the polytropic efficiency. The excellent performance of the method is demonstrated by performing the corrections over real industrial measurements.",1,An Iterative Method Applied to Correct the Actual Compressor Performance  to the Equivalent Performance under the Specified Reference Conditions

"In this paper, we consider multi-dimensional maximal cost-bounded reachability probability over continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs). Our major contributions are as follows. Firstly, we derive an integral characterization which states that the maximal cost-bounded reachability probability function is the least fixed point of a system of integral equations. Secondly, we prove that the maximal cost-bounded reachability probability can be attained by a measurable deterministic cost-positional scheduler. Thirdly, we provide a numerical approximation algorithm for maximal cost-bounded reachability probability. We present these results under the setting of both early and late schedulers.",1,Maximal Cost-Bounded Reachability Probability on Continuous-Time Markov  Decision Processes

"The Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter is proposed for state estimation and fault diagnosis in distributed parameter systems and particularly in dynamical systems described by partial differential equations of the nonlinear wave type. At a first stage, a nonlinear filtering approach for estimating the dynamics of a 1D nonlinear wave equation, from measurements provided from a small number of sensors is developed. It is shown that the numerical solution of the associated partial differential equation results into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. With the application of diffeomorphism that is based on differential flatness theory it is shown that an equivalent description of the system is obtained in the linear canonical (Brunovsky) form. This transformation enables to obtain local estimates about the state vector of the system through the application of the standard Kalman Filter recursion. At a second stage, the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis is used to perform fault diagnosis for the distributed parameters system by processing with elaborated statistical tools the differences (residuals) between the output of the Kalman Filter and the measurements obtained from the distributed parameter system. Optimal selection of the fault threshold is succeeded by using the local statistical approach to fault diagnosis. The efficiency of the proposed filtering approach for performing fault diagnosis in distributed parameters systems is confirmed through simulation experiments.",1,A Kalman Filtering approach of improved precision for fault diagnosis in  distributed parameter systems

Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, given a family of linear systems possibly containing unstable dynamics, we propose a large class of switching signals that stabilize a switched system generated by the switching signal and the given family of systems. Secondly, given a switched system, a sufficient condition for the existence of the proposed switching signal is derived by expressing the switching signal as an infinite walk on a directed graph representing the switched system. Thirdly, given a family of linear systems, we propose an algorithmic technique to design a switching signal for stabilizing the corresponding switched system.",1,Stabilizing discrete-time switched linear systems
"Optimal experiment design for parameter estimation is a research topic that has been in the interest of various studies. A key problem in optimal input design is that the optimal input depends on some unknown system parameters that are to be identified. Adaptive design is one of the fundamental routes to handle this problem. Although there exist a rich collection of results on adaptive experiment design, there are few results that address these issues for dynamic systems. This paper proposes an adaptive input design method for general single-input single-output linear-time-invariant systems.",1,Adaptive experiment design for LTI systems
"The small medium large system (SMLSystem) is a house built at the Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH) for participation in the Solar Decathlon 2013 competition. Several technologies have been integrated to reduce power consumption. One of these is a forecasting system based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is able to predict indoor temperature in the near future using captured data by a complex monitoring system as the input. A study of the impact on forecasting performance of different covariate combinations is presented in this paper. Additionally, a comparison of ANNs with the standard statistical forecasting methods is shown. The research in this paper has been focused on forecasting the indoor temperature of a house, as it is directly related to HVAC---heating, ventilation and air conditioning---system consumption. HVAC systems at the SMLSystem house represent 53.9% of the overall power consumption. The energy used to maintain temperature was measured to be 30--38.9% of the energy needed to lower it. Hence, these forecasting measures allow the house to adapt itself to future temperature conditions by using home automation in an energy-efficient manner. Experimental results show a high forecasting accuracy and therefore, they might be used to efficiently control an HVAC system.",1,Towards Energy Efficiency: Forecasting Indoor Temperature via  Multivariate Analysis
"We consider the problem of cooperative intersection management. It arises in automated transportation systems for people or goods but also in multi-robots environment. Therefore many solutions have been proposed to avoid collisions. The main problem is to determine collision-free but also deadlock-free and optimal algorithms. Even with a simple definition of optimality, finding a global optimum is a problem of high complexity, especially for open systems involving a large and varying number of vehicles. This paper advocates the use of a mathematical framework based on a decomposition of the problem into a continuous optimization part and a scheduling problem. The paper emphasizes connections between the usual notion of vehicle priority and an abstract formulation of the scheduling problem in the coordination space. A constructive locally optimal algorithm is proposed. More generally, this work opens up for new computationally efficient cooperative motion planning algorithms.",1,Optimal cooperative motion planning for vehicles at intersections
"The paper tailors the so-called wave-based control popular in the field of flexible mechanical structures to the field of distributed control of vehicular platoons. The proposed solution augments the symmetric bidirectional control algorithm with a wave-absorbing controller implemented on the leader, and/or on the rear-end vehicle. The wave-absorbing controller actively absorbs an incoming wave of positional changes in the platoon and thus prevents oscillations of inter-vehicle distances. The proposed controller significantly improves the performance of platoon manoeuvrers such as acceleration/deceleration or changing the distances between vehicles without making the platoon string unstable. Numerical simulations show that the wave-absorbing controller performs efficiently even for platoons with a large number of vehicles, for which other platooning algorithms are inefficient or require wireless communication between vehicles.",1,Wave-absorbing vehicular platoon controller
"This paper deals with the problem of enforcing modular diagnosability for discrete-event systems that don't satisfy this property by their natural modularity. We introduce an approach to achieve this property combining existing modules into new virtual modules. An underlining mathematical problem is to find a partition of a set, such that the partition satisfies the required property. The time complexity of such problem is very high. To overcome it, the paper introduces a structural analysis of the system's modules. In the analysis we focus on the case when the modules participate in diagnosis with their observations, rather then the case when indistinguishable observations are blocked due to concurrency.",1,Virtual Modules in Discrete-Event Systems: Achieving Modular  Diagnosability
"While the asymptotic stability of positive linear systems in the presence of bounded time delays has been thoroughly investigated, the theory for nonlinear positive systems is considerably less well-developed. This paper presents a set of conditions for establishing delay-independent stability and bounding the decay rate of a significant class of nonlinear positive systems which includes positive linear systems as a special case. Specifically, when the time delays have a known upper bound, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential stability of (a) continuous-time positive systems whose vector fields are homogeneous and cooperative, and (b) discrete-time positive systems whose vector fields are homogeneous and order preserving. We then present explicit expressions that allow us to quantify the impact of delays on the decay rate and show that the best decay rate of positive linear systems that our bounds provide can be found via convex optimization. Finally, we extend the results to general linear systems with time-varying delays.",1,Exponential Stability of Homogeneous Positive Systems of Degree One With  Time-Varying Delays
"The Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used in this paper to control the voltage profiles in MV networks with distributed generation. The proposed algorithm lies at the intermediate level of a three-layer hierarchical structure. At the upper level a static Optimal Power Flow (OPF) manager computes the required voltage profiles to be transmitted to the MPC level, while at the lower level local Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR), one for each Distributed Generator (DG), track the reactive power reference values computed by MPC. The control algorithm is based on an impulse response model of the system, easily obtained by means of a detailed simulator of the network, and allows to cope with constraints on the voltage profiles and/or on the reactive power flows along the network. If these constraints cannot be satisfied by acting on the available DGs, the algorithm acts on the On-Load Tap Changing (OLTC) transformer. A radial rural network with two feeders, eight DGs, and thirty-one loads is used as case study. The model of the network is implemented in DIgSILENT PowerFactory, while the control algorithm runs in Matlab. A number of simulation results is reported to witness the main characteristics and limitations of the proposed approach.",1,Model predictive control of voltage profiles in MV networks with  distributed generation

"The ultra large multi-agent systems are becoming increasingly popular due to quick decay of the individual production costs and the potential of speeding up the solving of complex problems. Examples include nano-robots, or systems of nano-satellites for dangerous meteorite detection, or cultures of stem cells for organ regeneration or nerve repair. The topics associated with these systems are usually dealt within the theories of intelligent swarms or biologically inspired computation systems. Stochastic models play an important role and they are based on various formulations of the mechanical statistics. In these cases, the main assumption is that the swarm elements have a simple behaviour and that some average properties can be deduced for the entire swarm. In contrast, complex systems in areas like aeronautics are formed by elements with sophisticated behaviour, which are even autonomous. In situations like this, a new approach to swarm coordination is necessary. We present a stochastic model where the swarm elements are communicating autonomous systems, the coordination is separated from the component autonomous activity and the entire swarm can be abstracted away as a piecewise deterministic Markov process, which constitutes one of the most popular model in stochastic control. Keywords: ultra large multi-agent systems, system of systems, autonomous systems, stochastic hybrid systems.",1,A coordination model for ultra-large scale systems of systems
"The goal of this paper is to study the impact of the dynamic nature of bus voltage magnitudes and phase angles, which constitute the state of the power system, on the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. To facilitate this study, the placement problem is addressed from the perspective of the electrical structure which, unlike existing work on PMU placement, accounts for the sensitivity between power injections and nodal phase angle differences between various buses in the power network. A linear dynamic model captures the time evolution of system states, and a simple procedure is devised to estimate the state transition function at each time instant. The placement problem is formulated as a series (time steps) of binary integer programs, with the goal to obtain the minimum number of PMUs at each time step for complete network observability in the absence of zero injection measurements. Experiments are conducted on several standard IEEE test bus systems. The main thesis of this study is that, owing to the dynamic nature of the system states, for optimal power system operation the best one could do is to install a PMU on each bus of the given network, though it is undesirable from an economic standpoint.",1,Impact of system state dynamics on PMU placement in the electric power  grid

"Posynomials are nonnegative combinations of monomials with possibly fractional and both positive and negative exponents. Posynomial models are widely used in various engineering design endeavors, such as circuits, aerospace and structural design, mainly due to the fact that design problems cast in terms of posynomial objectives and constraints can be solved efficiently by means of a convex optimization technique known as geometric programming (GP). However, while quite a vast literature exists on GP-based design, very few contributions can yet be found on the problem of identifying posynomial models from experimental data. Posynomial identification amounts to determining not only the coefficients of the combination, but also the exponents in the monomials, which renders the identification problem numerically hard. In this draft, we propose an approach to the identification of multivariate posynomial models, based on the expansion on a given large-scale basis of monomials. The model is then identified by seeking coefficients of the combination that minimize a mixed objective, composed by a term representing the fitting error and a term inducing sparsity in the representation, which results in a problem formulation of the ``square-root LASSO'' type, with nonnegativity constraints on the variables. We propose to solve the problem via a sequential coordinate-descent scheme, which is suitable for large-scale implementations.",1,Sparse Identification of Posynomial Models
We investigate resilient control strategies for linear systems under Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. By DoS attacks we mean interruptions of communication on measurement (sensor-to-controller) and/or control (controller-to-actuator) channels carried out by an intelligent adversary. We characterize the duration of these interruptions under which stability of the closed-loop system is preserved. The resilient nature of the control descends from its ability to adapt the sampling rate to the occurrence of the DoS.,1,Resilient Control under Denial-of-Service
"There are numerous advantages of using Electric Vehicles (EVs) as an alternative method of transportation. However, an increase in EV usage in the existing residential distribution grid poses problems such as overloading the existing infrastructure. In this paper, we have modeled and simulated a residential distribution grid in GridLAB-D (an open-source software tool used to model, simulate, and analyze power distribution systems) to illustrate the problems associated with a higher EV market penetration rates in the residential domain. Power grid upgrades or control algorithms at the transformer level are required to overcome issues such as transformer overloading. We demonstrate the method of coordinating EV charging in a residential distribution grid so as to overcome the overloading problem without any upgrades in the distribution grid.",1,Modeling and Simulation of the EV Charging in a Residential Distribution  Power Grid
"The response time of the smart electrical vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is the key index of the system performance. The traffic between the smart EV charging station and the control center dominates the response time of the smart charging stations. To accelerate the response of the smart EV charging station, there is a need for a technology that collects the information locally and relays it to the control center periodically. To reduce the traffic between the smart EV charger and the control center, a Power Information Collector (PIC), capable of collecting all the meters power information in the charging station, is proposed and implemented in this paper. The response time is further reduced by pushing the power information to the control center. Thus, a fast response smart EV charging infrastructure is achieved to handle the shortage of energy in the local grid.",1,Design of Fast Response Smart Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure
"In motion Kinematics, it is well-known that the time derivative of a 3x3rotation matrix equals a skew-symmetric matrix multiplied by the rotation matrix where the skew symmetric matrix is a linear (matrix valued) function of the angular velocity and the rotation matrix represents the rotating motion of a frame with respect to a reference frame. The equation is widely used in engineering, e.g., robotics, control, air/spacecraft modeling, etc. However, the derivations found in the literature are indirect. Motivated by the fact that the set of 3x3rotation matrices, i.e., SO(3), is a Lie group, forming a smooth (differentiable) manifold, we describe the infinitesimal increment of the rotation matrix in terms of rotation matrices and show that the above equation immediately follows.",1,Derivative of Rotation Matrix Direct Matrix Derivation of Well Known  Formula

"Many perceive electric vehicles (EVs) to be eco-environmentally sustainable because they are free of emissions of toxic and greenhouse gases to the environment. However, few have questioned the sustainability of the electric power required to drive these vehicles. This paper presents an in-depth study that indicates that massive infusion of EVs to our society in a short time span will likely create a colossal demand for additional electric power generation much beyond what the US electric power generating industry can provide with its current generating capacity. Additionally, such demand would result in much adverse environmental consequences if the current technology of electric power generation by predominant fossil fuels continues. Other rarely accounted facts on environmental impacts by EVs are the substantial electric energy required to produce batteries that drive EVs, and the negative consequences relating to the recycling of spent batteries.",1,On the Sustainability of Electrical Vehicles
"In this paper analysis is given to find the third order intermodulation power given sinusoids are fed into a nonlinear device. A simple expression of the third order intermodulation power is given for the case that the center frequencies of the input sinusoids are equally spaced. Further, if the powers of the signals are equal, the expression becomes a closed form expression. The analysis will be helpful for communication system engineering in estimating the adjacent channel interference due to nonlinearity. Numerical results are presented for various values of (number of input channels). Though the analysis assumes the input signals to be sinusoids without phase modulation, the third order intermodulation power estimate serves as a good estimate for link budget computation purpose. For the case that the center frequencies of the input sinusoids are not spaced equally, the analysis can still highly likely be applied if we insert pseudo channels in between the real channels so that all (real and pseudo) channels are spaced equally (or approximately equally for approximation). In this case, the pseudo channel powers are set to zero so that the interference powers due to the pseudo channels will not be included in the analysis. In other words, the analysis is highly likely applicable without the constraint of the input channel center frequencies being equally likely. Simulations are also provided for the case that the input sinusoids are QPSK modulated.",1,Third Order Intermodulation Power Estimation for N Sinusoidal Channels

"In this paper, we model energy use in commercial buildings using empirical data captured through sMAP, a campus building data portal at UC Berkeley. We conduct at-scale experiments in a newly constructed building on campus. By modulating the supply duct static pressure (SDSP) for the main supply air duct, we induce a response on the main supply fan and determine how much ancillary power flexibility can be provided by a typical commercial building. We show that the consequent intermittent fluctuations in the air mass flow into the building does not influence the building climate in a human-noticeable way. We estimate that at least 4 GW of regulation reserve is readily available only through commercial buildings in the US. Based on predictions this value will reach to 5.6 GW in 2035. We also show how thermal slack can be leveraged to provide an ancillary service to deal with transient frequency fluctuations in the grid. We consider a simplified model of the grid power system with time varying demand and generation and present a simple control scheme to direct the ancillary service power flow from buildings to improve on the classical automatic generation control (AGC)-based approach.

"Battery's role in the development of smart grid is gaining greater attention as an energy storage device that can be integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV) cell in the distribution circuit. As more PVs are connected to the system, real power injection to the distribution can cause fluctuation in the voltage. Due to the rapid fluctuation of the voltage, a more advanced volt-ampere reactive (VAR) power control scheme on a fast time scale is used to minimize the voltage deviation on the distribution. Employing both global and local dynamic VAR control schemes in our previous work, we show the effects of battery placement on the performance of VAR controls in the example of a single branch radial distribution circuit. Simulations verify that having battery placement at the rear in the distribution circuit can provide smaller voltage variations and higher energy savings than front battery placement when used with dynamic VAR control algorithms.",1,Battery Placement on Performance of VAR Controls
"We study the problem of estimating an unknown deterministic signal that is observed through an unknown deterministic data matrix under additive noise. In particular, we present a minimax optimization framework to the least squares problems, where the estimator has imperfect data matrix and output vector information. We define the performance of an estimator relative to the performance of the optimal least squares (LS) estimator tuned to the underlying unknown data matrix and output vector, which is defined as the regret of the estimator. We then introduce an efficient robust LS estimation approach that minimizes this regret for the worst possible data matrix and output vector, where we refrain from any structural assumptions on the data. We demonstrate that minimizing this worst-case regret can be cast as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. We then consider the regularized and structured LS problems and present novel robust estimation methods by demonstrating that these problems can also be cast as SDP problems. We illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithms with respect to the well-known alternatives in the literature through our simulations.",1,Robust Least Squares Methods Under Bounded Data Uncertainties

"This paper studies the problem of output agreement in networks of nonlinear dynamical systems under time-varying disturbances, using dynamic diffusive couplings. Necessary conditions are derived for general networks of nonlinear systems, and these conditions are explicitly interpreted as conditions relating the node dynamics and the network topology. For the class of incrementally passive systems, necessary and sufficient conditions for output agreement are derived. The approach proposed in the paper lends itself to solve flow control problems in distribution networks. As a first case study, the internal model approach is used for designing a controller that achieves an optimal routing and inventory balancing in a dynamic transportation network with storage and time-varying supply and demand. It is in particular shown that the time-varying optimal routing problem can be solved by applying an internal model controller to the dual variables of a certain convex network optimization problem. As a second case study, we show that droop-controllers in microgrids have also an interpretation as internal model controllers.",1,Dynamic coupling design for nonlinear output agreement and time-varying  flow control
"Multi-modal densities appear frequently in time series and practical applications. However, they cannot be represented by common state estimators, such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), which additionally suffer from the fact that uncertainty is often not captured sufficiently well, which can result in incoherent and divergent tracking performance. In this paper, we address these issues by devising a non-linear filtering algorithm where densities are represented by Gaussian mixture models, whose parameters are estimated in closed form. The resulting method exhibits a superior performance on typical benchmarks.",1,Multi-modal filtering for non-linear estimation
"This article reviews different kinds of models for the electric power grid that can be used to understand the modern power system, the smart grid. From the physical network to abstract energy markets, we identify in the literature different aspects that co-determine the spatio-temporal multilayer dynamics of power system. We start our review by showing how the generation, transmission and distribution characteristics of the traditional power grids are already subject to complex behaviour appearing as a result of the the interplay between dynamics of the nodes and topology, namely synchronisation and cascade effects. When dealing with smart grids, the system complexity increases even more: on top of the physical network of power lines and controllable sources of electricity, the modernisation brings information networks, renewable intermittent generation, market liberalisation, prosumers, among other aspects. In this case, we forecast a dynamical co-evolution of the smart grid and other kind of networked systems that cannot be understood isolated. This review compiles recent results that model electric power grids as complex systems, going beyond pure technological aspects. From this perspective, we then indicate possible ways to incorporate the diverse co-evolving systems into the smart grid model using, for example, network theory and multi-agent simulation.",1,Models for the modern power grid
This letter proposes a novel sparsity-aware adaptive filtering scheme and algorithms based on an alternating optimization strategy with shrinkage. The proposed scheme employs a two-stage structure that consists of an alternating optimization of a diagonally-structured matrix that speeds up the convergence and an adaptive filter with a shrinkage function that forces the coefficients with small magnitudes to zero. We devise alternating optimization least-mean square (LMS) algorithms for the proposed scheme and analyze its mean-square error. Simulations for a system identification application show that the proposed scheme and algorithms outperform in convergence and tracking existing sparsity-aware algorithms.,1,Sparsity-Aware Adaptive Algorithms Based on Alternating Optimization  with Shrinkage
"Consider that an autonomous linear time-invariant (LTI) plant is given and that a network of LTI observers assesses its output vector. The dissemination of information within the network is dictated by a pre-specified directed graph in which each vertex represents an observer. Each observer computes its own state estimate using only the portion of the output vector accessible to it and the state estimates of other observers that are transmitted to it by its neighbors, according to the graph. This paper proposes an update rule that is a natural generalization of consensus, and for which we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of parameters for the update rule that lead to asymptotic omniscience of the state of the plant at all observers. The conditions reduce to certain detectability requirements that imply that if omniscience is not possible under the proposed scheme then it is not viable under any other scheme that is subject to the same communication graph, including nonlinear and time-varying ones.",1,A Class of LTI Distributed Observers for LTI Plants: Necessary and  Sufficient Conditions for Stabilizability
"A key question that arises in rigorous analysis of cyberphysical systems under attack involves establishing whether or not the attacked system deviates significantly from the ideal allowed behavior. This is the problem of deciding whether or not the ideal system is an abstraction of the attacked system. A quantitative variation of this question can capture how much the attacked system deviates from the ideal. Thus, algorithms for deciding abstraction relations can help measure the effect of attacks on cyberphysical systems and to develop attack detection strategies. In this paper, we present a decision procedure for proving that one nonlinear dynamical system is a quantitative abstraction of another. Directly computing the reach sets of these nonlinear systems are undecidable in general and reach set over-approximations do not give a direct way for proving abstraction. Our procedure uses (possibly inaccurate) numerical simulations and a model annotation to compute tight approximations of the observable behaviors of the system and then uses these approximations to decide on abstraction. We show that the procedure is sound and that it is guaranteed to terminate under reasonable robustness assumptions.",1,Proving Abstractions of Dynamical Systems through Numerical Simulations

This paper proposes a discrete-time output-feedback RC design for a class of systems subject to measurable nonlinearities to track reference robustly with respect to the period variation. The design relies on additive state decomposition, by which the output-feedback RC problem is decomposed into an output-feedback RC problem for a linear time-invariant system and a state-feedback stabilization problem for a nonlinear system. Thanks to the decomposition, existing controller design methods in both the frequency domain and time domain can be employed to make the robustness and discretization for a nonlinear system tractable.

"Several convex relaxations of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem have recently been developed using both bus injection models and branch flow models. In this paper, we prove relations among three convex relaxations: a semidefinite relaxation that computes a full matrix, a chordal relaxation based on a chordal extension of the network graph, and a second-order cone relaxation that computes the smallest partial matrix. We prove a bijection between the feasible sets of the OPF in the bus injection model and the branch flow model, establishing the equivalence of these two models and their second-order cone relaxations. Our results imply that, for radial networks, all these relaxations are equivalent and one should always solve the second-order cone relaxation. For mesh networks, the semidefinite relaxation is tighter than the second-order cone relaxation but requires a heavier computational effort, and the chordal relaxation strikes a good balance. Simulations are used to illustrate these results.",1,Equivalent relaxations of optimal power flow
"Randomized optimization is an established tool for control design with modulated robustness. While for uncertain convex programs there exist randomized approaches with efficient sampling, this is not the case for non-convex problems. Approaches based on statistical learning theory are applicable to non-convex problems, but they usually are conservative in terms of performance and require high sample complexity to achieve the desired probabilistic guarantees. In this paper, we derive a novel scenario approach for a wide class of random non-convex programs, with a sample complexity similar to that of uncertain convex programs and with probabilistic guarantees that hold not only for the optimal solution of the scenario program, but for all feasible solutions inside a set of a-priori chosen complexity. We also address measure-theoretic issues for uncertain convex and non-convex programs. Among the family of non-convex control- design problems that can be addressed via randomization, we apply our scenario approach to randomized Model Predictive Control for chance-constrained nonlinear control-affine systems.",1,A scenario approach for non-convex control design
"The control of a network of signalized intersections is considered. Previous works proposed a feedback control belonging to the family of the so-called back-pressure controls that ensures provably maximum stability given pre-specified routing probabilities. However, this optimal back-pressure controller (BP*) requires routing rates and a measure of the number of vehicles queuing at a node for each possible routing decision. It is an idealistic assumption for our application since vehicles (going straight, turning left/right) are all gathered in the same lane apart from the proximity of the intersection and cameras can only give estimations of the aggregated queue length. In this paper, we present a back-pressure traffic signal controller (BP) that does not require routing rates, it requires only aggregated queue lengths estimation (without direction information) and loop detectors at the stop line for each possible direction. A theoretical result on the Lyapunov drift in heavy load conditions under BP control is provided and tends to indicate that BP should have good stability properties. Simulations confirm this and show that BP stabilizes the queuing network in a significant part of the capacity region.",1,Back-pressure traffic signal control with unknown routing rates
"Swarm stability is concerned for descriptor compartmental networks with linear time-invariant protocol. Compartmental network is a specific type of dynamical multi-agent system. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both consensus and critical swarm stability are presented, which require a joint matching between the interactive dynamics of nearest neighboring vertices and the Laplacian spectrum of the overall network topology. Three numerical instances are illustrated to verify the theoretical results.",1,On Swarm Stability of Linear Time-Invariant Descriptor Compartmental  Networks
"A recursive state estimation procedure is derived for a linear time varying system with both parametric uncertainties and stochastic measurement droppings. This estimator has a similar form as that of the Kalman filter with intermittent observations, but its parameters should be adjusted when a plant output measurement arrives. A new recursive form is derived for the pseudo-covariance matrix of estimation errors, which plays important roles in analyzing its asymptotic properties. Based on a Riemannian metric for positive definite matrices, some necessary and sufficient conditions have been obtained for the strict contractiveness of an iteration of this recursion. It has also been proved that under some controllability and observability conditions, as well as some weak requirements on measurement arrival probability, the gain matrix of this recursive robust state estimator converges in probability one to a stationary distribution. Numerical simulation results show that estimation accuracy of the suggested procedure is more robust against parametric modelling errors than the Kalman filter.",1,Robust Recursive State Estimation with Random Measurements Droppings

"Subspace identification is revisited in the scope of nuclear norm minimization methods. It is shown that essential structural knowledge about the unknown data matrices in the data equation that relates Hankel matrices constructed from input and output data can be used in the first step of the numerical solution presented. The structural knowledge comprises the low rank property of a matrix that is the product of the extended observability matrix and the state sequence and the Toeplitz structure of the matrix of Markov parameters (of the system in innovation form). The new subspace identification method is referred to as the N2SID (twice the N of Nuclear Norm and SID for Subspace IDentification) method. In addition to include key structural knowledge in the solution it integrates the subspace calculation with minimization of a classical prediction error cost function. The nuclear norm relaxation enables us to perform such integration while preserving convexity. The advantages of N2SID are demonstrated in a numerical open- and closed-loop simulation study. Here a comparison is made with another widely used SID method, i.e. N4SID. The comparison focusses on the identification with short data batches, i.e. where the number of measurements is a small multiple of the system order.",1,Nuclear Norm Subspace Identification (N2SID) for short data batches
"Some necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the controllability and observability of a networked system with linear time invariant (LTI) dynamics. The topology of this system is fixed but arbitrary, and every subsystem is permitted to have different dynamic input-output relations. These conditions essentially depend only on transmission zeros of every subsystem and the connection matrix among subsystems, which makes them attractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large scale networked system. As an application, these conditions are utilized to characterize systems whose steady state estimation accuracy with the distributed predictor developed in (Zhou, 2013) is equal to that of the lumped Kalman filter. Some necessary and sufficient conditions on system matrices are derived for this equivalence. It has been made clear that to guarantee this equivalence, the steady state update gain matrix of the Kalman filter must be block diagonal.",1,On the Controllability and Observability of Networked Dynamic Systems
"We consider a network of event-based systems that use a shared wireless medium to communicate with their respective controllers. These systems use a contention resolution mechanism to arbitrate access to the shared network. We identify sufficient conditions for Lyapunov mean square stability of each control system in the network, and design event-based policies that guarantee it. Our stability analysis is based on a Markov model that removes the network-induced correlation between the states of the control systems in the network. Analyzing the stability of this Markov model remains a challenge, as the event-triggering policy renders the estimation error non-Gaussian. Hence, we identify an auxiliary system that furnishes an upper bound for the variance of the system states. Using the stability analysis, we design policies, such as the constant-probability policy, for adapting the event-triggering thresholds to the delay in accessing the network. Realistic wireless networked control examples illustrate the applicability of the presented approach.",1,Stability Analysis and Design of a Network of Event-based Systems
"In Model-Based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), it is often desirable to develop several models of varying fidelity. Models of different fidelity levels can enable mathematical analysis of the model, control synthesis, faster simulation etc. Furthermore, when (automatically or manually) transitioning from a model to its implementation on an actual computational platform, then again two different versions of the same system are being developed. In all previous cases, it is necessary to define a rigorous notion of conformance between different models and between models and their implementations. This paper argues that conformance should be a measure of distance between systems. Albeit a range of theoretical distance notions exists, a way to compute such distances for industrial size systems and models has not been proposed yet. This paper addresses exactly this problem. A universal notion of conformance as closeness between systems is rigorously defined, and evidence is presented that this implies a number of other application-dependent conformance notions. An algorithm for detecting that two systems are not conformant is then proposed, which uses existing proven tools. A method is also proposed to measure the degree of conformance between two systems. The results are demonstrated on a range of models.",1,Conformance Testing as Falsification for Cyber-Physical Systems

"There has been much research on network flows over time due to their important role in real world applications. This has led to many results, but the more challenging continuous time model still lacks some of the key concepts and techniques that are the cornerstones of static network flows. The aim of this paper is to advance the state of the art for dynamic network flows by developing the continuous time analogues of the theory for static network flows. Specifically, we make use of ideas from the static case to establish a reduced cost optimality condition, a negative cycle optimality condition, and a strong duality result for a very general class of network flows over time.",1,Flows over time in time-varying networks
"This paper studies near-controllability of a class of discrete-time bilinear systems via a root locus approach. A necessary and sufficient criterion for the systems to be nearly controllable is given. In particular, by using the root locus approach, the control inputs which achieve the state transition for the nearly controllable systems can be computed. Furthermore, for the non-nearly controllable systems, nearly-controllable subspaces are derived and near-controllability index is defined. Accordingly, the controllability properties of such class of discrete-time bilinear systems are fully characterized. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate the results of the paper.",1,"On Near-controllability, Nearly-controllable Subspaces, and  Near-controllability Index of a Class of Discrete-time Bilinear Systems: A  Root Locus Approach"
"Based on a reduced-order, dynamic nonlinear wind turbine model in Takagi-Sugeno (TS) model structure, a TS state observer is designed as a disturbance observer to estimate the unknown effective wind speed. The TS observer model is an exact representation of the underlying nonlinear model, obtained by means of the sector-nonlinearity approach. The observer gain matrices are obtained by means of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) design approach for optimal fuzzy control, where weighting matrices for the individual system states and outputs are included. The observer is tested in simulations with the aero-elastic code FAST for the NREL 5 MW reference turbine, where it shows a stable behaviour both for IEC wind gusts and turbulent wind input.",1,Wind Turbine Model and Observer in Takagi-Sugeno Model Structure
"This paper focuses on cascading line failures in the transmission system of the power grid. Recent large-scale power outages demonstrated the limitations of percolation- and epid- emic-based tools in modeling cascades. Hence, we study cascades by using computational tools and a linearized power flow model. We first obtain results regarding the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the power grid admittance matrix. Based on these results, we study the impact of a single line failure on the flows on other lines. We also illustrate via simulation the impact of the distance and resistance distance on the flow increase following a failure, and discuss the difference from the epidemic models. We then study the cascade properties, considering metrics such as the distance between failures and the fraction of demand (load) satisfied after the cascade (yield). We use the pseudo-inverse of admittance matrix to develop an efficient algorithm to identify the cascading failure evolution, which can be a building block for cascade mitigation. Finally, we show that finding the set of lines whose removal has the most significant impact (under various metrics) is NP-Hard and introduce a simple heuristic for the minimum yield problem. Overall, the results demonstrate that using the resistance distance and the pseudo-inverse of admittance matrix provides important insights and can support the development of efficient algorithms.",1,Cascading Failures in Power Grids - Analysis and Algorithms
"Different approaches have been used in the development of system models. In addition, modeling and simulation approaches are essential for design, analysis, control, and diagnosis of complex systems. This work presents a Simulink model for systems with mixed continuous and discrete behaviors. The model simulated was developed using the bond graph methodology and we model hybrid systems using hybrid bond graphs (HBGs), that incorporates local switching functions that enable the reconfiguration of energy flow paths. This approach has been implemented as a software tool called the MOdeling and Transformation of HBGs for Simulation (MOTHS) tool suite which incorporates a model translator that create Simulink models.

"Long horizon lengths in Moving Horizon Estimation are desirable to reach the performance limits of the full information estimator. However, the conventional MHE technique suffers from a number of deficiencies in this respect. First, the problem complexity scales at least linearly with the horizon length selected, which restrains from selecting long horizons if computational limitations are present. Second, there is no monitoring of constraint activity/inactivity which results in conducting redundant constrained minimizations even when no constraints are active. In this study we develop a Multiple-Window Moving Horizon Estimation strategy (MW-MHE) that exploits constraint inactivity to reduce the problem size in long horizon estimation problems. The arrival cost is approximated using the unconstrained full information estimator arrival cost to guarantee stability of the technique. A new horizon length selection criteria is developed based on maximum sensitivity between remote states in time. The development will be in terms of general causal descriptor systems, which includes the standard state space representation as a special case. The potential of the new estimation algorithm will be demonstrated with an example showing a significant reduction in both computation time and numerical errors compared to conventional MHE.",1,Multiple Window Moving Horizon Estimation
"A new optimization method for the design of nearly linear-phase IIR digital filters that satisfy prescribed specifications is proposed. The group-delay deviation is minimized under the constraint that the passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within the prescribed specifications and either a prescribed or an optimized group delay can be achieved. By representing the filter in terms of a cascade of second-order sections, a non-restrictive stability constraint characterized by a set of linear inequality constraints can be incorporated in the optimization algorithm. An additional feature of the method, which is very useful in certain applications, is that it provides the capability of constraining the maximum gain in transition bands to be below a prescribed level. Experimental results show that filters designed using the proposed method have much lower group-delay deviation for the same passband ripple and stopband attenuation when compared with corresponding filters designed with several state-of-the-art competing methods.",1,Improved Design Method for Nearly Linear-Phase IIR Filters Using  Constrained Optimization

This allows to capture abstraction processes or signal aggregation in the context of control and verification of large scale systems. For this new system model different notions of simulation and bisimulation are derived, ensuring that they are, respectively, preorders and equivalence relations for the system class under consideration. These relations can capture a wide selection of similarity notions available in the literature.

"A good state-time quantized symbolic abstraction of an already input quantized control system would satisfy three conditions: proximity, soundness and completeness. Extant approaches for symbolic abstraction of unstable systems limit to satisfying proximity and soundness but not completeness. Instability of systems is an impediment to constructing fully complete state-time quantized symbolic models for bounded and quantized input unstable systems, even using supervisory feedback. Therefore, in this paper we come up with a way of parametrization of completeness of the symbolic model through the quintessential notion of Trimmed-Input Approximate Bisimulation which is introduced in the paper. The amount of completeness is specified by a parameter called trimming of the set of input trajectories. We subsequently discuss a procedure of constructing state-time quantized symbolic models which are near-complete in addition to being sound and proximate with respect to the time quantized models.",1,Parametrization of completeness in symbolic abstraction of bounded input  linear systems
"In this paper, pseudo-transient continuation method has been modified and implemented in power system long-term stability analysis. This method is a middle ground between integration and steady state calculation, thus is a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Pseudo-transient continuation method can be applied in the long-term stability model directly to accelerate simulation speed and can also be implemented in the QSS model to overcome numerical difficulties. Numerical examples show that pseudo-transient continuation method can provide correct approximations for the long-term stability model in terms of trajectories and stability assessment.",1,Application of Pseudo-Transient Continuation Method in Dynamic Stability  Analysis

"A standard approach to optimizing long-run running costs of discrete systems is based on minimizing the mean-payoff, i.e., the long-run average amount of resources (energy) consumed per transition. However, this approach inherently assumes that the energy source has an unbounded capacity, which is not always realistic. For example, an autonomous robotic device has a battery of finite capacity that has to be recharged periodically, and the total amount of energy consumed between two successive charging cycles is bounded by the capacity. Hence, a controller minimizing the mean-payoff must obey this restriction. In this paper we study the controller synthesis problem for consumption systems with a finite battery capacity, where the task of the controller is to minimize the mean-payoff while preserving the functionality of the system encoded by a given linear-time property. We show that an optimal controller always exists, and it may either need only finite memory or require infinite memory (it is decidable in polynomial time which of the two cases holds). Further, we show how to compute an effective description of an optimal controller in polynomial time. Finally, we consider the limit values achievable by larger and larger battery capacity, show that these values are computable in polynomial time, and we also analyze the corresponding rate of convergence. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results about optimizing the long-run running costs in systems with bounded energy stores.",1,Minimizing Running Costs in Consumption Systems
"This paper investigates performance limitations and tradeoffs in the control design for linear time-invariant systems. It is shown that control specifications in time domain and in frequency domain are always mutually exclusive determined by uncertainty relations. The uncertainty principle from quantum mechanics and harmonic analysis therefore embeds itself inherently in control theory. The relations among transient specifications, system bandwidth and control energy are obtained within the framework of uncertainty principle. If the control system is provided with a large bandwidth or great control energy, then it can ensure transient specifications as good as it can be. Such a control system could be approximated by prolate spheroidal wave functions. The obtained results are also applicable to filter design due to the duality of filtering and control.",1,"Uncertainty Principle in Control Theory, Part I: Analysis of Performance  Limitations"
"A number of biological rhythms originate from networks comprised of multiple cellular oscillators. But analytical results are still lacking on the collective oscillation period of inter-coupled gene regulatory oscillators, which, as has been reported, may be different from that of an autonomous oscillator. Based on cyclic feedback oscillators, we analyze the collective oscillation pattern of coupled cellular oscillators. First we give a condition under which the oscillator network exhibits oscillatory and synchronized behavior. Then we estimate the collective oscillation period based on a novel multivariable harmonic balance technique. Analytical results are derived in terms of biochemical parameters, thus giving insight into the basic mechanism of biological oscillation and providing guidance in synthetic biology design.",1,Collective oscillation period of inter-coupled biological negative  cyclic feedback oscillators
"This paper investigates adaptive zero reaction motion control for free-floating space manipulators with uncertain kinematics and dynamics. The challenge in deriving the adaptive reaction null-space (RNS) based control scheme is that it is difficult to obtain a linear expression, which is the basis of the adaptive control. The main contribution of this paper is that we skillfully obtain such a linear expression, based on which, an adaptive version of the RNS-based controller (referred to as the adaptive zero reaction motion controller in the sequel) is developed at the velocity level, taking into account both the kinematic and dynamic uncertainties. It is shown that the proposed controller achieves both the spacecraft attitude regulation and end-effector trajectory tracking.

"Social interactions influence our thoughts, opinions and actions. In this paper, social interactions are studied within a group of individuals composed of influential social leaders and followers. Each person is assumed to maintain a social state, which can be an emotional state or an opinion. Followers update their social states based on the states of local neighbors, while social leaders maintain a constant desired state. Social interactions are modeled as a general directed graph where each directed edge represents an influence from one person to another. Motivated by the non-local property of fractional-order systems, the social response of individuals in the network are modeled by fractional-order dynamics whose states depend on influences from local neighbors and past experiences. A decentralized influence method is then developed to maintain existing social influence between individuals (i.e., without isolating peers in the group) and to influence the social group to a common desired state (i.e., within a convex hull spanned by social leaders). Mittag-Leffler stability methods are used to prove asymptotic stability of the networked fractional-order system.",1,Containment Control for a Social Network with State-Dependent  Connectivity

By modeling the interaction among the agents as a graph, several different approaches to address the problems of preserving network connectivity are presented, with the focus on a method that utilizes navigation function frameworks. By modeling network connectivity constraints as artificial obstacles in navigation functions, a decentralized control strategy is presented in two particular applications, formation control and rendezvous for a system of autonomous agents, which ensures global convergence to the unique minimum of the potential field (i.e., desired formation or desired destination) while preserving network connectivity.

"The efficiency of modern optimization methods, coupled with increasing computational resources, has led to the possibility of real-time optimization algorithms acting in safety critical roles. There is a considerable body of mathematical proofs on on-line optimization programs which can be leveraged to assist in the development and verification of their implementation.

Despite the large body of work addressing PCOs, a global synchronization result for networks that are more general than all-to-all connected is still unavailable. In this paper we address global synchronization of PCO networks described by cycle graphs. It is shown for the bidirectional cycle case that as the number of oscillators in the cycle grows, the coupling strength must be increased in order to guarantee synchronization for arbitrary initial conditions. For the unidirectional cycle case, the strongest coupling cannot ensure global synchronization yet a refractory period in the phase response curve is sufficient to enable global synchronization. Analytical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations.",1,Global Synchronization of Pulse-Coupled Oscillators Interacting on Cycle  Graphs
"The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the presence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a combination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales. With the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation and demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal and feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the network resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to directly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints for active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a specific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when systems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common abstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is to say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their internal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of any size or complexity.

"We propose a stability analysis method for sampled-data switched linear systems with quantization. The available information to the controller is limited: the quantized state and switching signal at each sampling time. Switching between sampling times can produce the mismatch of the modes between the plant and the controller. Moreover, the coarseness of quantization makes the trajectory wander around, not approach, the origin. Hence the trajectory may leave the desired neighborhood if the mismatch leads to instability of the closed-loop system. For the stability of the switched systems, we develop a sufficient condition characterized by the total mismatch time. The relationship between the mismatch time and the dwell time of the switching signal is also discussed.",1,Quantized Feedback Stabilization of Sampled-Data Switched Linear Systems

To capture the physical properties of the network, we allow for weights associated to both the edges as well as the vertices of the graph. We extend the notion of almost equitable partitions to this class of graphs. Consequently, an explicit model reduction error expression in the sense of H2-norm is provided for clustering arising from almost equitable partitions.

"We propose and solve a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) problem addressing the optimal provision of regulation service reserves (RSR) by controlling dynamic demand preferences in smart buildings. A major contribution over past dynamic pricing work is that we pioneer the relaxation of static, uniformly distributed utility of demand. In this paper we model explicitly the dynamics of energy service preferences leading to a non-uniform and time varying probability distribution of demand utility. More explicitly, we model active and idle duty cycle appliances in a smart building as a closed queuing system with price-controlled arrival rates into the active appliance queue. Focusing on cooling appliances, we model the utility associated with the transition from idle to active as a non-uniform time varying function. We (i) derive an analytic characterization of the optimal policy and the differential cost function, and (ii) prove optimal policy monotonicity and value function convexity. These properties enable us to propose and implement a smart assisted value iteration (AVI) algorithm and an approximate DP (ADP) that exploits related functional approximations.

"The joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter is a popular tracking methodology for problems involving well-spaced targets, but it is rarely applied in problems with closely-spaced targets due to its complexity in these cases, and due to the well-known phenomenon of coalescence. This paper addresses these difficulties using random finite sets (RFSs) and variational inference, deriving a highly tractable, approximate method for obtaining the multi-Bernoulli distribution that minimises the set Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the true posterior, working within the RFS framework to incorporate uncertainty in target existence. The derivation is interpreted as an application of expectation-maximisation (EM), where the missing data is the correspondence of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks) under each data association hypothesis. The missing data is shown to play an identical role to the selection of an ordered distribution in the same ordered family in the set JPDA algorithm. Subsequently, a special case of the proposed method is utilised to provide an efficient approximation of the minimum mean optimal sub-pattern assignment estimator. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated in challenging scenarios in which up to twenty targets come into close proximity.",1,"An efficient, variational approximation of the best fitting  multi-Bernoulli filter"

"The objective of the research is to develop a general method of constructing Lyapunov functions for non-linear non-autonomous differential inclusions described by ordinary differential equations with parameters. The goal has been attained through the following ideas and tools. First, three-point Poincare strategy of the investigation of differential equations and manifolds has been used. Second, the geometric-topological structure of the non-linear non-autonomous parametric differential inclusions has been presented and analyzed in the framework of hierarchical fiber bundles. Third, a special canonizing transformation of the differential inclusions that allows to present them in special canonical form, for which certain standard forms of Lyapunov functions exist, has been found. The conditions establishing the relation between the local asymptotical stability of two corresponding particular integral curves of a given differential inclusion in its initial and canonical forms are ascertained. The global asymptotical stability of the entire free dynamical systems as some restrictions of a given parametric differential inclusion and the whole latter one per se has been investigated in terms of the classificational stability of the typical fiber of the meta-bundle.

"A simple step and search control strategy for extracting maximum output power from grid connected Variable Speed Wind Energy Conversion System (VSWECS) is implemented in this work. This system consists of a variable speed wind turbine coupled to a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) through a gear box, a DC-DC boost converter and a hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source Converter (VSC). The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) extracts maximum power from the wind turbine from cut-into rated wind velocity by sensing only by DC link power. This system can be connected to a micro-grid. Also it can be used for supplying an isolated local load by means of converting the output of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) to DC and then convert to AC by means of hysteresis current controlled Voltage Source Converter (VSI).",1,Step and Search Control Method to Track the Maximum Power in Wind Energy  Conversion Systems A Study
"In this paper we propose a method for applications oriented input design for linear systems under time-domain constraints on the amplitude of input and output signals. The method guarantees a desired control performance for the estimated model in minimum time, by imposing some lower bound on the information matrix. The problem is formulated as a time domain optimization problem, which is non-convex. This is addressed through an alternating method, where we separate the problem into two steps and at each step we optimize the cost function with respect to one of two variables. We alternate between these two steps until convergence. A time recursive input design algorithm is performed, which enables us to use the algorithm with control. Therefore, a receding horizon framework is used to solve each optimization problem. Finally, we illustrate the method with two numerical examples which show the good ability of the proposed approach in generating an optimal input signal.",1,Applications Oriented Input Design in Time-Domain Through Cyclic Methods
"Elementary hybrid systems (EHSs) are those hybrid systems (HSs) containing elementary functions such as exp, ln, sin, cos, etc. EHSs are very common in practice, especially in safety-critical domains. Due to the non-polynomial expressions which lead to undecidable arithmetic, verification of EHSs is very hard. Existing approaches based on partition of state space or over-approximation of reachable sets suffer from state explosion or inflation of numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a symbolic abstraction approach that reduces EHSs to polynomial hybrid systems (PHSs), by replacing all non-polynomial terms with newly introduced variables. Thus the verification of EHSs is reduced to the one of PHSs, enabling us to apply all the well-established verification techniques and tools for PHSs to EHSs. In this way, it is possible to avoid the limitations of many existing methods. We illustrate the abstraction approach and its application in safety verification of EHSs by several real world examples.",1,Abstraction of Elementary Hybrid Systems by Variable Transformation

"Networked Control Systems (NCS) are distributed systems where plants, sensors, actuators and controllers communicate over shared networks. Non-ideal behaviors of the communication network include variable sampling/transmission intervals and communication delays, packet losses, communication constraints and quantization errors. NCS have been the object of intensive study in the last few years. However, due to the inherent complexity of NCS, current literature focuses on a subset of these non-idealities and mostly considers stability and stabilizability problems. Recent technology advances need different and more complex control objectives to be considered. In this paper we present first a general model of NCS, including most relevant non-idealities of the communication network; then, we propose a symbolic model approach to the control design with objectives expressed in terms of non-deterministic transition systems. The presented results are based on recent advances in symbolic control design of continuous and hybrid systems. An example in the context of robot motion planning with remote control is included, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",1,Design of Symbolic Controllers for Networked Control Systems
"The integration of renewable sources poses challenges at the operational and economic levels of the power grid. In terms of keeping the balance between supply and demand, the usual scheme of supply following load may not be appropriate for large penetration levels of uncertain and intermittent renewable supply. In this paper, we focus on an alternative scheme in which the load follows the supply, exploiting the flexibility associated with the demand side. We consider a model of flexible loads that are to be serviced by zero-marginal cost renewable power together with conventional generation if necessary. Each load demands 1 kW for a specified number of time slots within an operational period. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the service may be delivered over any slots within the operational period. Loads therefore require flexible energy services that are differentiated by the demanded duration. We focus on two problems associated with durations-differentiated loads. The first problem deals with the operational decisions that a supplier has to make to serve a given set of duration differentiated loads. The second problem focuses on a market implementation for duration differentiated services. We give necessary and sufficient conditions under which the available power can service the loads, and we describe an algorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available supply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be purchased to service the loads. Next we consider a forward market where consumers can purchase duration differentiated energy services. We first characterize social welfare maximizing allocations in this forward market and then show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium.",1,Duration-Differentiated Services in Electricity
"This article deals with the consensus problem involving agents with time-varying singularities in the dynamics or communication in undirected graph networks. Existing results provide control laws which guarantee asymptotic consensus. These results are based on the analysis of a system switching between piecewise constant and time-invariant dynamics. This work introduces a new analysis technique relying upon classical notions of persistence of excitation to study the convergence properties of the time-varying multi-agent dynamics. Since the individual edge weights pass through singularities and vary with time, the closed-loop dynamics consists of a non-autonomous linear system. Instead of simplifying to a piecewise continuous switched system as in literature, smooth variations in edge weights are allowed, albeit assuming an underlying persistence condition which characterizes sufficient inter-agent communication to reach consensus. The consensus task is converted to edge-agreement in order to study a stabilization problem to which classical persistence based results apply. The new technique allows precise computation of the rate of convergence to the consensus value.",1,Persistence based analysis of consensus protocols for dynamic graph  networks
"Coupled Tank system used for liquid level control is a model of plant that has usually been used in industries especially chemical process industries. Level control is also very important for mixing reactant process. This survey paper tries to presents in a systemic way an approach predictive control strategy for a system that is similar to the process and is represented by two liquid tanks. This system of coupled Tank is one of the most commonly available systems representing a coupled Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system. With 2 inputs and 2 outputs, it is the most primitive form of a coupled multivariable system. Therefor the basic concept of how the coupled tanks system works is by using a numerical system which it operates with a flow control valve FCV as main control of the level of liquid in one tank or both tanks. For this paper, MPC algorithm control is used which will be developed below. And it is focuses on the design and modelling for coupled tanks system. The steps followed for the design of the controller are: Developing a state space system model for the coupled tank system then design an MPC controller for the developed system model. And study the effect of the disturbance on measured level output. Note that the implementation Model Predictive Controller on flow controller valve in a Coupled Tank liquid level system is one of the new methods of controlling liquid level.",1,Model Predictive Control (MPC) Applied To Coupled Tank Liquid Level  System
Flexibility in electric power consumption can be leveraged by Demand Response (DR) programs. The goal of this paper is to systematically capture the inherent aggregate flexibility of a population of appliances. We do so by clustering individual loads based on their characteristics and service constraints. We highlight the challenges associated with learning the customer response to economic incentives while applying demand side management to heterogeneous appliances. We also develop a framework to quantify customer privacy in direct load scheduling programs.,1,Capturing Aggregate Flexibility in Demand Response
"To respond to volatility and congestion in the power grid, demand response (DR) mechanisms allow for shaping the load compared to a base load profile. When tapping on a large population of heterogeneous appliances as a DR resource, the challenge is in modeling the dimensions available for control. Such models need to strike the right balance between accuracy of the model and tractability. The goal of this paper is to provide a medium-grained stochastic hybrid model to represent a population of appliances that belong to two classes: deferrable or thermostatically controlled loads. We preserve quantized information regarding individual load constraints, while discarding information about the identity of appliance owners. The advantages of our proposed population model are 1) it allows us to model and control load in a scalable fashion, useful for ex-ante planning by an aggregator or for real-time load control; 2) it allows for the preservation of the privacy of end-use customers that own submetered or directly controlled appliances.",1,Scalable and Anonymous Modeling of Large Populations of Flexible  Appliances

"In this work we propose an approximate Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) filter for linear dynamic systems with Gaussian Mixture noise. The proposed estimator tracks each component of the Gaussian Mixture (GM) posterior with an individual filter and minimizes the trace of the covariance matrix of the bank of filters, as opposed to minimizing the MSE of individual filters in the commonly used Gaussian sum filter (GSF). Hence, the spread of means in the proposed method is smaller than that of GSF which makes it more robust to removing components. Consequently, lower complexity reduction schemes can be used with the proposed filter without losing estimation accuracy and precision. This is supported through simulations on synthetic data as well as experimental data related to an indoor localization system. Additionally, we show that in two limit cases the state estimation provided by our proposed method converges to that of GSF, and we provide simulation results supporting this in other cases.",1,Approximate MMSE Estimator for Linear Dynamic Systems with Gaussian  Mixture Noise

"The linearization of nonlinear systems is an important digital enhancement technique. In this paper, a real-time capable post- and pre-linearization method for the widely applicable time-varying discrete-time Volterra series is presented. To this end, an alternative view on the Volterra series is established, which enables the utilization of certain modified linear iterative methods for linearization. For one particular linear iterative method, the Richardson iteration, the corresponding post- and pre-linearizers are discussed in detail. It is motivated that the resulting algorithm can be regarded as a generalization of some existing methods. Furthermore, a simply verifiable condition for convergence is presented, which allows the straightforward evaluation of applicability.

"Introduction. To assess the freshness of various products are often used measuring impedance module. But due to the structure of plant foods diagnostic value should have exactly a complex component of impedance. Article tasked with developing criteria for assessing the functional state of the products subject to a comprehensive component of the impedance. Research methodology. To determine the functional status of the fruit were measured module and phase of impedance at the three frequencies of 20, 100 and 500 kHz. Criteria for recognition of functional status determined by the dynamics of changes in the parameters of the complex impedance due to destructive processes caused by dehydration and putrefaction processes. Data processing and analysis. On the basis of experimental data obtained at three frequencies modeled frequency and phase response and their changes during losing of freshness and appearance of destructive processes. Discussion and conclusions. In fresh and stale fruit modulus and phase of the impedance at low and high frequencies have characteristic differences. But this is especially evident on the phase-frequency characteristic, which can be seen that the value of the phase with the loss of freshness at low frequency decreases and increases at high more than twice during one week. Therefore, to assess the functional state of fresh and stale products we suggest use phase portraits of phase response.",1,Determination of the functional state of the fruits by parameters of the  electric impedance

"The diffusion LMS algorithm has been extensively studied in recent years. This efficient strategy allows to address distributed optimization problems over networks in the case where nodes have to collaboratively estimate a single parameter vector. Problems of this type are referred to as single-task problems. Nevertheless, there are several problems in practice that are multitask-oriented in the sense that the optimum parameter vector may not be the same for every node. This brings up the issue of studying the performance of the diffusion LMS algorithm when it is run, either intentionally or unintentionally, in a multitask environment. In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis on the stochastic behavior of diffusion LMS in the case where the so-called single-task hypothesis is violated. We explain under what conditions diffusion LMS continues to deliver performance superior to non-cooperative strategies in the multitask environment. When the conditions are violated, we explain how to endow the nodes with the ability to cluster with other similar nodes to remove bias. We propose an unsupervised clustering strategy that allows each node to select, via adaptive adjustments of combination weights, the neighboring nodes with which it can collaborate to estimate a common parameter vector. Simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results, and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed clustering strategy. The framework is applied to a useful problem involving a multi-target tracking task.",1,Diffusion LMS over Multitask Networks

At the same time, a hybrid model which serves as a remedy to the QSS model is proposed according to causes for failure of the QSS model and dynamic mechanisms of long-term instabilities. Numerical examples are given to show that the developed hybrid model can successfully capture unstable behaviors of the long-term stability model while the QSS model fails.",1,"Quasi Steady-State Model for Power System Stability: Limitations,  Analysis and a Remedy"
"Automated synthesis of reactive control protocols from temporal logic specifications has recently attracted considerable attention in various applications in, for example, robotic motion planning, network management, and hardware design. An implicit and often unrealistic assumption in this past work is the availability of complete and precise sensing information during the execution of the controllers. In this paper, we use an abstraction procedure for systems with partial observation and propose a formalism to investigate effects of limitations in sensing. The abstraction procedure enables the existing synthesis methods with partial observation to be applicable and efficient for systems with infinite (or finite but large number of) states. This formalism enables us to systematically discover sensing modalities necessary in order to render the underlying synthesis problems feasible. We use counterexamples, which witness unrealizability potentially due to the limitations in sensing and the coarseness in the abstract system, and interpolation-based techniques to refine the model and the sensing modalities, i.e., to identify new sensors to be included, in such synthesis problems. We demonstrate the method on examples from robotic motion planning.",1,"Abstractions and sensor design in partial-information, reactive  controller synthesis"

"This paper presents a modified multi model predictive control algorithm for the control of riser outlet temperature and regenerator temperature for the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). The models of the fluid catalytic cracking unit are estimated using subspace identification (N4SID) algorithm. The PRBS signal is applied as an input signal to estimate the FCCU models. Since the estimated model does not give 100% fit; especially for nonlinear systems having more than one operating conditions, multi-model approach is proposed. In multi model, more than one model of FCCU used in MPC design.

"In many signal processing applications it is required to estimate the unobservable state of a dynamic system from its noisy measurements. For linear dynamic systems with Gaussian Mixture (GM) noise distributions, Gaussian Sum Filters (GSF) provide the MMSE state estimate by tracking the GM posterior. However, since the number of the clusters of the GM posterior grows exponentially over time, suitable reduction schemes need to be used to maintain the size of the bank in GSF. In this work we propose a low computational complexity reduction scheme which uses an initial state estimation to find the active noise clusters and removes all the others. Since the performance of our proposed method relies on the accuracy of the initial state estimation, we also propose five methods for finding this estimation. We provide simulation results showing that with suitable choice of the initial state estimation (based on the shape of the noise models), our proposed reduction scheme provides better state estimations both in terms of accuracy and precision when compared with other reduction methods.",1,A New Reduction Scheme for Gaussian Sum Filters

The key point is the introduction of a fictitious control input that allows us to consider the complete system dynamics, which is assumed to be linear with respect to the base parameters.

"We study a stabilization problem of linear uncertain systems with parametric uncertainties via feedback control over data-rate-constrained channels. The objective is to find the limitation on the amount of information that must be conveyed through the channels for achieving stabilization and in particular how the plant uncertainties affect it. We derive a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for stabilizing the closed-loop system. These conditions provide limitations in the form of bounds on data rate and magnitude of uncertainty on plant parameters. The bounds are characterized by the product of the poles of the nominal plant and are less conservative than those known in the literature.

"In this paper, a simulation-based method for the analysis and design of abstracted models for a stochastic hybrid system is proposed. The accuracy of a model is evaluated in terms of its capability to reproduce the system output for all the realizations of the stochastic input except for a set of (small) probability epsilon (epsilon-abstraction). This naturally leads to chance-constrained optimization problems, which are here tackled by means of a recently developed randomized approach. The main thrust of this paper is that, by testing how close the model and system outputs are over a finite number N of input realizations only, conclusions can be drawn about the model capability as an epsilon-abstraction. The key feature of the proposed method is its high versatility since it does not require specific assumptions on the system to be approximated. The only requirement is that of being able to run multiple simulations of the system behavior for different input realizations.",1,Performance assessment and design of abstracted models for stochastic  hybrid systems through a randomized approach

"In this paper, we consider the consensus problem of switched multi-agent system composed of continuous-time and discrete-time subsystems. By combining the classical consensus protocols of continuous-time and discrete-time multi-agent systems, we propose a linear consensus protocol for switched multi-agent system. Based on the graph theory and Lyapunov theory, we prove that the consensus of switched multi-agent system is solvable under arbitrary switching with undirected connected graph, directed graph and switching topologies, respectively. Simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",1,Consensus of switched multi-agent systems
"We propose a dynamical model for cascading failures in single-commodity network flows. In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and activation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly state-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity on the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network state, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed dynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition on itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between link activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive successively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern of cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard cascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of cumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the margin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the magnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node become inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the margin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access to information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when the routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we identify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper bound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on making connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state evolution under proposed dynamics.",1,Robust Network Routing under Cascading Failures
"The aim of this paper is to propose diffusion strategies for distributed estimation over adaptive networks, assuming the presence of spatially correlated measurements distributed according to a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model. The proposed methods incorporate prior information about the statistical dependency among observations, while at the same time processing data in real-time and in a fully decentralized manner. A detailed mean-square analysis is carried out in order to prove stability and evaluate the steady-state performance of the proposed strategies. Finally, we also illustrate how the proposed techniques can be easily extended in order to incorporate thresholding operators for sparsity recovery applications. Numerical results show the potential advantages of using such techniques for distributed learning in adaptive networks deployed over GMRF.",1,Diffusion Adaptation Strategies for Distributed Estimation over Gaussian  Markov Random Fields
"This paper investigates the feasibility of using a discriminate pricing scheme to offset the inconvenience that is experienced by an energy user (EU) in trading its energy with an energy controller in smart grid. The main objective is to encourage EUs with small distributed energy resources (DERs), or with high sensitivity to their inconvenience, to take part in the energy trading via providing incentive to them with relatively higher payment at the same time as reducing the total cost to the energy controller. The proposed scheme is modeled through a two-stage Stackelberg game that describes the energy trading between a shared facility authority (SFA) and EUs in a smart community. A suitable cost function is proposed for the SFA to leverage the generation of discriminate pricing according to the inconvenience experienced by each EU. It is shown that the game has a unique sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE), under the certain condition at which the SFA's total cost is minimized, and that each EU receives its best utility according to its associated inconvenience for the given price. A backward induction technique is used to derive a closed form expression for the price function at SPE, and thus the dependency of price on an EU's different decision parameters is explained for the studied system. Numerical examples are provided to show the beneficial properties of the proposed scheme.",1,Feasibility of Using Discriminate Pricing Schemes for Energy Trading in  Smart Grid
"In this paper, a nonlinear extension of the Georgiou-Smith system is considered and robustness results are proved for a class of nonlinear PI controllers with respect to fast parasitic first-order dynamics. More specifically, for a perturbed nonlinear system with sector bounded nonlinearity and unknown control direction, sufficient conditions for global boundedness and attractivity have been derived. It is shown that the closed loop system is globally bounded and attractive if (i) the unmodelled dynamics are sufficiently fast and (ii) the PI control gain has the Nussbaum function property. For the case of nominally unstable systems, the Nussbaum property of the control gain appears to be crucial.

As a result, a necessary and sufficient condition for uniform consensus is proposed.",1,Almost Decouplability of any Directed Weighted Network Topology
"In this paper we develop an algorithm for peak load reduction to reduce the impact of increased air conditioner usage in a residential smart grid community. We develop Demand Response Management (DRM) plans that clearly spell out the maximum duration as well as maximum severity of inconvenience. We model the air conditioner as a power throttling device and for any given DRM plan we study the impact of increasing the number of power states on the resulting peak load reduction. Through simulations, we find out that adding just one additional state to the basic ON/OFF model, which can throttle power to 50% of the rated air conditioner power, can result in significant amount of peak reduction. However, the peak load that can be reduced is diminishing with the increase in number of states. Furthermore, we also observe the impact of inconvenience duration and inconvenience severity in terms of peak load reduction. These observations can serve as useful guidelines for developing appropriate DRM plans.",1,Demand Response Management For Power Throttling Air Conditioning Loads  In Residential Smart Grids
"The smart grid spawns many innovative ideas, but many of them cannot be easily integrated into the existing power system due to power system constraints, such as the lack of capacity to transport renewable energy in remote areas to the urban centers. An energy delivery system can be built upon the traffic network and electric vehicles (EVs) utilized as energy carriers to transport energy over a large geographical region. A generalized architecture called the vehicular energy network (VEN) is constructed and a mathematically tractable framework is developed. Dynamic wireless (dis)charging allows electric energy, as an energy packet, to be added and subtracted from EV batteries seamlessly. With proper routing, energy can be transported from the sources to destinations through EVs along appropriate vehicular routes. This paper gives a preliminary study of VEN. Models are developed to study its operational and economic feasibilities with real traffic data in the United Kingdom. Our study shows that a substantial amount of renewable energy can be transported from some remote wind farms to London under some reasonable settings and VEN is likely to be profitable in the near future. VEN can complement the power network and enhance its power delivery capability.",1,Vehicular Energy Network
"Increased distributed Photo-Voltaic (PV) generation leads to an increase in voltages and unwarranted backflows into the grid. This paper investigates Demand Response (DR) with Electric Water Heaters (EWHs) as a way to increase the PV hosting capacity of a low-voltage feeder. A control strategy relying only on power measurements at the transformer is proposed. Flexible loads are optimally dispatched considering energy acquisition costs, a PV shedding penalty, and power and energy constraints. Furthermore, grouping of loads and PV plants is investigated, and switching penalties are used to reduce the unnecessary switching of loads. It is shown that this strategy can substantially increase the PV hosting capacity of a Low-Voltage (LV) feeder, even when only basic controllability is available.",1,PV Integration in Low-Voltage Feeders with Demand Response
A controller design technique for shaping the frequency response of a process is described. A general linear model (GLM) is used to define the form of a lag or lead compensator in discrete time using a prescribed set of basis functions. The model is then transformed via the complex z-domain into a difference equation for a recursive digital filter with an infinite impulse response (IIR). A polynomial basis set is better for shaping the frequency response in the near-zero region; whereas a sinusoidal basis set is better for defining the response at arbitrary frequencies. The proposed compensator design method is more flexible than existing low-order approaches and more suitable than other general-purpose high-order methods. Performance of the resulting controller is compared with digital proportional-integral-differential (PID) and linear-state-space (LSS) algorithms in a real motor-control application.,1,Direct Digital Design of Loop-Shaping Filters for Sampled Control  Systems

"We introduce a distributed, cooperative framework and method for Bayesian estimation and control in decentralized agent networks. Our framework combines joint estimation of time-varying global and local states with information-seeking control optimizing the behavior of the agents. It is suited to nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems and, in particular, to location-aware networks. For cooperative estimation, a combination of belief propagation message passing and consensus is used. For cooperative control, the negative posterior joint entropy of all states is maximized via a gradient ascent. The estimation layer provides the control layer with probabilistic information in the form of sample representations of probability distributions. Simulation results demonstrate intelligent behavior of the agents and excellent estimation performance for a simultaneous self-localization and target tracking problem. In a cooperative localization scenario with only one anchor, mobile agents can localize themselves after a short time with an accuracy that is higher than the accuracy of the performed distance measurements.",1,Distributed Estimation with Information-Seeking Control in Agent Network

Adaptive recursive least squares algorithm is used to identification of Laguerre model. Various structures of Hammerstein, Wiener, Hammerstein-Wiener models are tested and the MATLAB simulation results are compared. The mean square error is used for models validation. It has been found that Hammerstein-Wiener with orthonormal basis functions improves the quality of approximation plant dynamics. The mean square error for this model is 11% on average throughout the considered range of the external disturbances amplitude. The analysis also showed that Wiener model cannot provide sufficient approximation accuracy of the cone crusher dynamics. During the process it is unstable due to the high sensitivity to disturbances on the output.

"This paper considers the problem of state tracking with observation control for a particular class of dynamical systems. The system state evolution is described by a discrete-time, finite-state Markov chain, while the measurement process is characterized by a controlled multi-variate Gaussian observation model. The computational complexity of the optimal control strategy proposed in our prior work proves to be prohibitive. A suboptimal, lower complexity algorithm based on the Fisher information measure is proposed. Toward this end, the preceding measure is generalized to account for multi-valued discrete parameters and control inputs. A closed-form formula for our system model is also derived.

We use Lyapunov operators, duality, and the Luenberger observer framework to reformulate the synthesis problem as a convex optimization problem expressed as a set of Linear-Operator-Inequalities (LOIs). We then show how feasibility of these LOIs may be tested using Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and the Sum-of-Squares methodology.",1,A Convex Approach to Output Feedback Control of Parabolic PDEs Using  Sum-of-Squares
"Controllers are often designed based on a reduced or simplified model of the plant dynamics. In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to synthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control systems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of the slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we know how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how to design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is modeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to generate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the sampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the stability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two transmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time for the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in practice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that existing event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed systems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second, we propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered results in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined amount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the advantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic stability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum inter-transmission interval. We believe that this technique is of its own interest independently of the two-time scale nature of the addressed problem. The results are shown to be applicable to a class of globally Lipschitz systems.",1,Event-triggered control of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems based  only on the slow dynamics
"The objective is to design output feedback event-triggered controllers to stabilize a class of nonlinear systems. One of the main difficulties of the problem is to ensure the existence of a minimum amount of time between two consecutive transmissions, which is essential in practice. We solve this issue by combining techniques from event-triggered and time-triggered control. The idea is to turn on the event-triggering mechanism only after a fixed amount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This time is computed based on results on the stabilization of time-driven sampled-data systems. The overall strategy ensures an asymptotic stability property for the closed-loop system. The results are proved to be applicable to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems as a particular case.",1,Stabilization of nonlinear systems using event-triggered output feedback  controllers
"As the proportion of total power supplied by renewable sources increases, it gets more costly to use reserve generation to compensate for the variability of renewables like solar and wind. Hence attention has been drawn to exploiting flexibility in demand as a substitute for reserve generation. Flexibility has different attributes. In this paper we consider loads requiring a constant power for a specified duration (within say one day), whose flexibility resides in the fact that power may be delivered at any time so long as the total duration of service equals the load's specified duration. We give conditions under which a variable power supply is adequate to meet these flexible loads, and describe how to allocate the power to the loads. We also characterize the additional power needed when the supply is inadequate. We study the problem of allocating the available power to loads to maximize welfare, and show that the welfare optimum can be sustained as a competitive equilibrium in a forward market in which electricity is sold as service contracts differentiated by the duration of service and power level. We compare this forward market with a spot market in their ability to capture the flexiblity inherent in duration-differentiated loads.",1,Duration-differentiated Energy Services with a Continuum of Loads
"We present a procedure to simultaneously design the output feedback law and the event-triggering condition to stabilize linear systems. The closed-loop system is shown to satisfy a global asymptotic stability property and the existence of a strictly positive minimum amount of time between two transmissions is guaranteed. The event-triggered controller is obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). We then exploit the flexibility of the method to maximize the guaranteed minimum amount of time between two transmissions. Finally, we provide a (heuristic) method to reduce the amount of transmissions, which is supported by numerical simulations.",1,Co-design of output feedback laws and event-triggering conditions for  linear systems
"A fundamental problem that the bearing rigidity theory studies is to determine when a framework can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by its inter-neighbor bearings. While many previous works focused on the bearing rigidity of two-dimensional frameworks, a first contribution of this paper is to extend these results to arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that a framework in an arbitrary dimension can be uniquely determined up to a translation and a scaling factor by the bearings if and only if the framework is infinitesimally bearing rigid. In this paper, the proposed bearing rigidity theory is further applied to the bearing-only formation stabilization problem where the target formation is defined by inter-neighbor bearings and the feedback control uses only bearing measurements. Nonlinear distributed bearing-only formation control laws are proposed for the cases with and without a global orientation. It is proved that the control laws can almost globally stabilize infinitesimally bearing rigid formations. Numerical simulations are provided to support the analysis.",1,Bearing Rigidity and Almost Global Bearing-Only Formation Stabilization
"Non intrusive load monitoring (NILM), or energy disaggregation, is the process of separating the total electricity consumption of a building as measured at single point into the building's constituent loads. Previous research in the field has mostly focused on residential buildings, and although the potential benefits of applying this technology to commercial buildings have been recognised since the field's conception, NILM in the commercial domain has been largely unexplored by the academic community. As a result of the heterogeneity of this section of the building stock (i.e., encompassing buildings as diverse as airports, malls and coffee shops), and hence the loads within them, many of the solutions developed for residential energy disaggregation do not apply directly. In this paper we highlight some insights for NILM in the commercial domain using data collected from a large smart meter deployment within an educational campus in Delhi, India, of which a subset of the data has been released for public use. We present an empirical characterisation of loads in commercial buildings, highlighting the differences in energy consumption and load characteristics between residential and commercial buildings. We assess the validity of the assumptions generally made by NILM solutions for residential buildings when applied to measurements from commercial facilities. Based on our observations, we discuss the required traits for a NILM system for commercial buildings, and run benchmark residential NILM algorithms on our data set to confirm our observations. To advance the research in commercial buildings energy disaggregation, we release a subset of our data set, called COMBED (commercial building energy data set).",1,A comparison of non-intrusive load monitoring methods for commercial and  residential buildings
"In this paper we propose an output-feedback Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for linear discrete-time systems affected by a possibly unbounded additive noise and subject to probabilistic constraints. In case the noise distribution is unknown, the chance constraints on the input and state variables are reformulated by means of the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality. The recursive feasibility of the proposed algorithm is guaranteed and the convergence of the state to a suitable neighbor of the origin is proved under mild assumptions. The implementation issues are thoroughly addressed showing that, with a proper choice of the design parameters, its computational load can be made similar to the one of a standard stabilizing MPC algorithm. Two examples are discussed in details, with the aim of providing an insight on the performance achievable by the proposed control scheme.",1,An MPC approach to output-feedback control of stochastic linear  discrete-time systems
"Determining the induced L2 norm of a linear, parameter-varying (LPV) system is an integral part of many analysis and robust control design procedures. Most prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced L2 norm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain theorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter dependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to compute lower bounds for the induced L2 norm. The proposed approach computes a lower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a periodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact calculation of the L2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The proposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound complements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between the bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more complex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm returns a bad parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further analyzed to provide insight into the system performance.",1,Computation of lower bounds for the induced L2 norm of LPV systems

"Motivated by the fact that transfer functions do not contain structural information about networks, dynamical structure functions were introduced to capture causal relationships between measured nodes in networks. From the dynamical structure functions, a) we show that the actual number of hidden states can be larger than the number of hidden states estimated from the corresponding transfer function; b) we can obtain partial information about the true state-space equation, which cannot in general be obtained from the transfer function. Based on these properties, this paper proposes algorithms to find minimal realisations for a given dynamical structure function. This helps to estimate the minimal number of hidden states, to better understand the complexity of the network, and to identify potential targets for new measurements.",1,On minimal realisations of dynamical structure functions
The problem of finding a finite state symbolic model which is bisimilar to a hybrid dynamical system (HDS) and has the minimum number of states is considered. The considered class of HDS allows for discrete-valued inputs that only affect the jumps (events) of the HDS. Representation of the HDS in the form of a transition system is revisited in comparison with prior works. An algorithm is proposed for solving the problem which gives the bisimulation with the minimum number of states if it already exists and also a parameter of the algorithm is properly tuned. There is no need for stability assumptions and no time discretization is applied. The results are applied to an example,1,A Computational Approach to Bisimulation of Hybrid Dynamical Systems
"Gait velocity has been consistently shown to be an important indicator and predictor of health status, especially in older adults. Gait velocity is often assessed clinically, but the assessments occur infrequently and thus do not allow optimal detection of key health changes when they occur. In this paper, we show the time it takes a person to move between rooms in their home denoted 'transition times' can predict gait velocity when estimated from passive infrared motion detectors installed in a patient's own home. Using a support vector regression approach to model the relationship between transition times and gait velocities, we show that velocity can be predicted with an average error less than 2.5 cm/sec. This is demonstrated with data collected over a 5 year period from 74 older adults monitored in their own homes. This method is simple and cost effective, and has advantages over competing approaches such as: obtaining 20 to100x more gait velocity measurements per day, and offering the fusion of location specific information with time stamped gait estimates. These advantages allow stable estimates of gait parameters (maximum or average speed, variability) at shorter time scales than current approaches. This also provides a pervasive in home method for context aware gait velocity sensing that allows for monitoring of gait trajectories in space and time.",1,Continuous Gait Velocity Estimation using Houseohld Motion Detectors

"Analysis of transient stability of strongly nonlinear post-fault dynamics is one of the most computationally challenging parts of Dynamic Security Assessment. This paper proposes a novel approach for assessment of transient stability of the system. The approach generalizes the idea of energy methods, and extends the concept of energy function to a more general Lyapunov Functions Family (LFF) constructed via Semi-Definite-Programming techniques. Unlike the traditional energy function and its variations, the constructed Lyapunov functions are proven to be decreasing only in a finite neighborhood of the equilibrium point. However, we show that they can still certify stability of a broader set of initial conditions in comparison to the traditional energy function in the closest-UEP method. Moreover, the certificates of stability can be constructed via a sequence of convex optimization problems that are tractable even for large scale systems. We also propose specific algorithms for adaptation of the Lyapunov functions to specific initial conditions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a number of IEEE test cases.",1,Lyapunov Functions Family Approach to Transient Stability Assessment

"In this paper we present a framework to efficiently characterize the available operational flexibility in a multi-area power system. We focus on the available reserves and the tie-line flows. The proposed approach is an alternative to the current calculation of the Available Transfer Capacity (ATC), as it considers location and availability of reserves, transmission constraints, and interdependencies of tie-line flows between different areas, while it takes into account the N-1 security criterion. The method is based on computational geometry using polytopic projections. It requires only a limited amount of information exchange and does not need central coordination. The method has two versions: a passive and an active approach, where neighboring areas can share reserves. In that respect we also introduce the term exported flexibility, which could form the basis for a new trading product in electricity markets. Case studies demonstrate the improved tie-line utilization, especially if reserves are shared, and the visualization benefits.",1,Managing Flexibility in Multi-Area Power Systems

We obtain sufficient asymptotic stabilization conditions for the closed-loop switched stochastic system under our proposed control law. We then explore the case where exact knowledge of the stochastic properties of mode observation instants is not available. We present a set of alternative stabilization conditions for this case. The results for both cases are predicated on the analysis of a sequence-valued process that encapsulates the stochastic nature of the evolution of active operation mode between mode observation instants.

This dual viewpoint extends in a straightforward manner to suggest metrics between matrix-valued measures. Our main interest has been in developing weakly-continuous metrics that are suitable for comparing matrix-valued power spectral density functions. To this end, and following the suggested recipe of utilizing suitable families of test functions, we develop a weakly-continuous metric that is analogous to the Wasserstein metric and applies to matrix-valued densities. We use a numerical example to compare this metric to certain standard alternatives including a different version of a matricial Wasserstein metric developed earlier.",1,Metrics for matrix-valued measures via test functions

"Energy conservation is a key factor towards long term energy sustainability. Real-time end user energy feedback, using disaggregated electric load composition, can play a pivotal role in motivating consumers towards energy conservation. Recent works have explored using high frequency conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) on power lines as a single point sensing parameter for monitoring common home appliances. However, key questions regarding the reliability and feasibility of using EMI signatures for non-intrusive load monitoring over multiple appliances across different sensing paradigms remain unanswered. This work presents some of the key challenges towards using EMI as a unique and time invariant feature for load disaggregation. In-depth empirical evaluations of a large number of appliances in different sensing configurations are carried out, in both laboratory and real world settings. Insights into the effects of external parameters such as line impedance, background noise and appliance coupling on the EMI behavior of an appliance are realized through simulations and measurements. A generic approach for simulating the EMI behavior of an appliance that can then be used to do a detailed analysis of real world phenomenology is presented. The simulation approach is validated with EMI data from a router.

The control problem is formulated as a two-timescale optimal power flow problem with chance constraints, which minimizes power loss while limiting the probability of voltage violations due to fast changes in load. The control problem forms the basis of an optimization problem which determines the sizes of the control devices by minimizing sum of the expected power loss cost and the capital cost. We develop computationally efficient heuristics to solve the optimal sizing problem and implement real-time control.

"We consider platoons composed of identical vehicles and controlled in a distributed way, that is, each vehicle has its own onboard controller. The regulation errors in spacing to the immediately preceeding and following vehicles are weighted differently by the onboard controller, which thus implements an asymmetric bidirectional control scheme. The weights can vary along the platoon. We prove that such platoons have a nonzero uniform bound on the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian matrix - the Fiedler eigenvalue. Furthermore, it is shown that existence of this bound always signals undesirable scaling properties of the platoon. Namely, the H-infinity norm of the transfer function of the platoon grows exponentially with the number of vehicles regardless of the controllers used. Hence the benefits of a uniform gap in the spectrum of a Laplacian with an asymetric distributed controller are paid for by poor scaling as the number of vehicles grows.",1,Nonzero bound on Fiedler eigenvalue causes exponential growth of  H-infinity norm of vehicular platoon
"In this paper we study theoretical properties of inverter-based microgrids controlled via primary and secondary loops. Stability of these microgrids has been the subject of a number of recent studies. Conventional approaches based on standard hierarchical control rely on time-scale separation between primary and secondary control loops to show local stability of equilibria. In this paper we show that (i) frequency regulation can be ensured without assuming time-scale separation and, (ii) ultimate boundedness of the trajectories starting inside a region of the state space can be guaranteed under a condition on the inverters power injection errors. The trajectory ultimate bound can be computed by simple iterations of a nonlinear mapping and provides a certificate of the overall performance of the controlled microgrid.",1,Ultimate boundedness of droop controlled Microgrids with secondary loops
"Residential Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) such as Air Conditioners (ACs), heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators have an enormous thermal storage potential for providing regulation reserve to the grid. In this paper, we study the potential resource and economic analysis of TCLs providing frequency regulation service. In particular, we show that the potential resource of TCLs in California is more than enough for both current and predicted near-future regulation requirements for the California power system. Moreover, we estimate the cost and revenue of TCLs, discuss the qualification requirements, recommended policy changes, and participation incentive methods, and compare TCLs with other energy storage technologies. We show that TCLs are potentially more cost-effective than other energy storage technologies such as flywheels, Li-ion, advanced lead acid, and Zinc Bromide batteries.",1,Potentials and Economics of Residential Thermal Loads Providing  Regulation Reserve
"We propose to synthesize a control policy for a Markov decision process (MDP) such that the resulting traces of the MDP satisfy a linear temporal logic (LTL) property. We construct a product MDP that incorporates a deterministic Rabin automaton generated from the desired LTL property. The reward function of the product MDP is defined from the acceptance condition of the Rabin automaton. This construction allows us to apply techniques from learning theory to the problem of synthesis for LTL specifications even when the transition probabilities are not known a priori. We prove that our method is guaranteed to find a controller that satisfies the LTL property with probability one if such a policy exists, and we suggest empirically with a case study in traffic control that our method produces reasonable control strategies even when the LTL property cannot be satisfied with probability one.",1,A Learning Based Approach to Control Synthesis of Markov Decision  Processes for Linear Temporal Logic Specifications
"This paper presents a consensus algorithm for a multi-agent system where each agent has access to its imperfect own state and neighboring state measurements. The measurements are subject to deterministic disturbances and the proposed algorithm provides a minimum-energy estimate of the measured states which is instrumental in achieving consensus by the nodes. It is shown that the proposed consensus algorithm converges exponentially in the absence of disturbances, and its performance under bounded continuous disturbances is investigated as well. The convergence performance of the proposed method is further studied using simulations where we show that consensus is achieved despite using large measurement errors.",1,Minimum-Energy Distributed Consensus of Uncertain Agents
"This paper addresses the distributed consensus problem for a linear multi-agent system with switching directed communication topologies. By appropriately introducing a linear transformation, the consensus problem is equivalently converted to a stabilization problem for a class of switched linear systems. Some sufficient consensus conditions are then derived by using tools from the matrix theory and stability analysis of switched systems. It is proved that consensus in such a multi-agent system can be ensured if each agent is stabilizable and each possible directed topology contains a directed spanning tree. Finally, a numerical simulation is given for illustration.",1,Distributed Consensus of Linear Multi-Agent Systems with Switching  Directed Topologies
"Airborne wind energy systems aim to harvest the power of winds blowing at altitudes higher than what conventional wind turbines reach. They employ a tethered flying structure, usually a wing, and exploit the aerodynamic lift to produce electrical power. In the case of ground-based systems, where the traction force on the tether is used to drive a generator on the ground, a two phase power cycle is carried out: one phase to produce power, where the tether is reeled out under high traction force, and a second phase where the tether is recoiled under minimal load. The problem of controlling a tethered wing in this second phase, the retraction phase, is addressed here, by proposing two possible control strategies. Theoretical analyses, numerical simulations, and experimental results are presented to show the performance of the two approaches. Finally, the experimental results of complete autonomous power generation cycles are reported and compared with first-principle models.",1,Automatic Retraction and Full Cycle Operation for a Class of Airborne  Wind Energy Generators
"We propose a macroscopic traffic network flow model suitable for analysis as a dynamical system, and we qualitatively analyze equilibrium flows as well as convergence. Flows at a junction are determined by downstream supply of capacity as well as upstream demand of traffic wishing to flow through the junction. This approach is rooted in the celebrated Cell Transmission Model for freeway traffic flow. Unlike related results which rely on certain system cooperativity properties, our model generally does not possess these properties. We show that the lack of cooperativity is in fact a useful feature that allows traffic control methods, such as ramp metering, to be effective. Finally, we leverage the results of the paper to develop a linear program for optimal ramp metering.",1,A Compartmental Model for Traffic Networks and its Dynamical Behavior
"In this paper, we present a Fingerprint Linear Estimation Routine (FLiER) to identify topology changes in power networks using readings from sparsely-deployed phasor measurement units (PMUs). When a power line, load, or generator trips in a network, or when a substation is reconfigured, the event leaves a unique voltage fingerprint of bus voltage changes that we can identify using only the portion of the network directly observed by the PMUs. The naive brute-force approach to identify a failed line from such voltage fingerprints, though simple and accurate, is slow. We derive an approximate algorithm based on a local linearization and a novel filtering approach that is faster and only slightly less accurate. We present experimental results using the IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus, and Polish 1999-2000 winter peak networks.",1,FLiER: Practical Topology Update Detection Using Sparse PMUs
"Electrical energy production based on wind power has become the most popular renewable resources in the recent years because it gets reliable clean energy with minimum cost. The major challenge for wind turbines is the electrical and the mechanical failures which can occur at any time causing prospective breakdowns and damages and therefore it leads to machine downtimes and to energy production loss. To circumvent this problem, several tools and techniques have been developed and used to enhance fault detection and diagnosis to be found in the stator current signature for wind turbines generators. Among these methods, parametric or super-resolution frequency estimation methods, which provides typical spectrum estimation, can be useful for this purpose. Facing on the plurality of these algorithms, a comparative performance analysis is made to evaluate robustness based on different metrics: accuracy, dispersion, computation cost, perturbations and faults severity. Finally, simulation results in MATLAB with most occurring faults indicate that ESPRIT and R-MUSIC algorithms have high capability of correctly identifying the frequencies of fault characteristic components, a performance ranking had been carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the studied methods in faults detecting.",1,Performance Analysis of Faults Detection in Wind Turbine Generator Based  on High-Resolution Frequency Estimation Methods
"We extend the results of the general small-gain theorem proposed by Z.P Jiang. The significance of this extension is two fold. First, it allows one to use general vector norm to characterize the input-to-output property of two interconnected subsystems. Second, the gain from input signals to output of each sub-system is provided, which offers one more flexibility in control design.",1,An Extended Small-Gain Theorem
"The integration of renewable generation poses operational and economic challenges for the electricity grid. For the core problem of power balance, the legacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be inappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable generation. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the alternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers compelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This approach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires sensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control algorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper considers rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for flexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery window, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and the maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward market where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation policies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a generation mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also purchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The supplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to sell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making real-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its expected profit. We offer solutions to the supplier's decision and control problems to economically provide rate constrained energy services.",1,Rate-constrained Energy Services: Allocation Policies and Market  Decisions

"A robust entry guidance law without drag rate measurement is designed for drag-tracking in this paper. The bank angle is regarded as the control variable. First, a state feedback guidance law (bank angle magnitude) that requires the drag and its rate as feedback information is designed to make the drag-tracking error be input-to-state stable (ISS) with respect to uncertainties. Then a high gain observer is utilized to estimate the drag rate which is difficult for a vehicle to measure accurately in practice. Stability analysis as well as simulation results show the efficiency of the presented approach.",1,Drag-Tracking Guidance for Entry Vehicles Without Drag Rate Measurement
"In this paper we investigate how the equilibrium characteristics of conventional power systems may change with an increase in wind penetration. We first derive a differential-algebraic model of a power system network consisting of synchronous generators, loads and a wind power plant modeled by a wind turbine and a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The models of these three components are coupled via nonlinear power flow equations. In contrast to the traditional approach for solving the power flows via iterative methods that often lead to only local solutions, we apply a recently developed parameter-homotopy based numerical continuation algorithm to compute all possible solutions. The method solves the power flow equations over multiple values of the wind penetration level with far less computational effort instead of solving them at each value individually. We observe that depending on the penetration limit and the setpoint value for the magnitude of the wind bus voltage, the system may exhibit several undesired or even unstable equilibria. We illustrate these results through a detailed simulation of a 5-machine power system model with wind injection, and highlight how the solutions may be helpful for small-signal stability assessment.",1,Exploring the Impact of Wind Penetration on Power System Equilibrium  Using a Numerical Continuation Approach

So how to provide such high metadata performance with such enormous number of files and large scale directories is a big challenge for Linux file system. We viewed that metadata lookup operations dominate metadata workload and incur low metadata performance.

"We consider continuous-time consensus systems whose interactions satisfy a form or reciprocity that is not instantaneous, but happens over time. We show that these systems have certain desirable properties: They always converge independently of the specific interactions taking place and there exist simple conditions on the interactions for two agents to converge to the same value. This was until now only known for systems with instantaneous reciprocity. These result are of particular relevance when analyzing systems where interactions are a priori unknown, being for example endogenously determined or random. We apply our results to an instance of such systems.",1,Continuous-Time Consensus under Non-Instantaneous Reciprocity
"This paper considers the distributed computation of confidence regions tethered to multidimensional parameter estimation under linear measurement models. In particular, the considered confidence regions are non-asymptotic, this meaning that the number of required measurements is finite. Distributed solutions for the computation of non-asymptotic confidence regions are proposed, suited to wireless sensor networks scenarios. Their performances are compared in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and numerically. The evidence emerging from the conducted investigations is that the best solution for information exchange depends on whether the network topology is structured or unstructured. The effect on the computation of confidence regions of information diffusion truncation is also examined. In particular, it is proven that consistent confidence regions can be computed even when an incomplete set of measurements is available.",1,Efficient Distributed Non-Asymptotic Confidence Regions Computation over  Wireless Sensor Networks
"This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for distributed sensing and estimation of a dynamic process by a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes wirelessly communicate measurements to the fusion center (FC). Cross-layer factors such as packet collisions and the sensing-transmission costs are considered. Each SN adapts its sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the estimation quality feedback from the FC under cost constraints for each SN. In this first part, the optimization complexity is reduced by exploiting the statistical symmetry and large network approximation of the WSN. Structural properties of the optimal policy are derived for a coordinated and a decentralized scheme. It is proved that a dense WSN provides sensing diversity, so that only a few SNs with the best local observation quality need to be activated, despite the fluctuations of the WSN. The optimal policy dictates that, when the estimation quality is poor, only the best SNs activate, otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve energy. The costs of coordination and feedback are evaluated, revealing the scalability of the decentralized scheme to large WSNs, at the cost of performance degradation. Simulation results demonstrate cost savings from 30% to 70% over a non-adaptive scheme, and significant gains over a previously proposed estimator which does not consider these cross-layer factors.",1,"Cross-layer design of distributed sensing-estimation with quality  feedback, Part I: Optimal schemes"
"This two-part paper presents a feedback-based cross-layer framework for distributed sensing and estimation of a dynamic process by a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes wirelessly communicate measurements to the fusion center (FC). Cross-layer factors such as packet collisions and the sensing-transmission costs are considered. Each SN adapts its sensing-transmission action based on its own local observation quality and the estimation quality feedback from the FC under cost constraints for each SN. In this second part, low-complexity myopic sensing-transmission policies (MPs) are designed to optimize a trade-off between performance and the cost incurred by each SN. The MP is computed in closed form for a coordinated scheme, whereas an iterative algorithm is presented for a decentralized one, which converges to a local optimum. The MP dictates that, when the estimation quality is poor, only the best SNs activate, otherwise all SNs remain idle to preserve energy. For both schemes, the threshold on the estimation quality below which the SNs remain idle is derived in closed form, and is shown to be independent of the number of channels. It is also proved that a single channel suffices for severely energy constrained WSNs. The proposed MPs are shown to yield near-optimal performance with respect to the optimal policy of Part I, at a fraction of the complexity, thus being more suitable for practical WSN deployments.",1,"Cross-layer design of distributed sensing-estimation with quality  feedback, Part II: Myopic schemes"

Additionally the design of a tracking system, for linear inertial position and yaw, is presented with simulation results. The gain matrix developed for this control system is independent of the specific quadrotor parameters, meaning that this same gain matrix can be used on a wide variety of quadrotors without modification.

"The paper presents a novel approach for the analysis and control of a multi-agent system with non-identical agents and a path-graph topology. With the help of irrational wave transfer functions, the approach describes the interaction among the agents from the `local' perspective and identifies travelling waves in the system. It is shown that different dynamics of the agents creates a virtual boundary that causes a partial reflection of the travelling waves. Undesired effects due to the reflection of the waves, such as amplification/attenuation, long transients or string instability, can be compensated by the feedback controllers introduced in this paper. We show that the controllers achieve asymptotic and even string stability of the system.",1,A travelling wave approach to a multi-agent system with a path-graph  topology
"A novel method for distributed estimation of the frequency of power systems is introduced based on the cooperation between multiple measurement nodes. The proposed distributed widely linear complex Kalman filter (D-ACKF) and the distributed widely linear extended complex Kalman filter (D-AECKF) employ a widely linear state space and augmented complex statistics to deal with unbalanced system conditions and the generality complex signals, both second order circular (proper) and second order noncircular (improper). It is shown that the current, strictly linear, estimators are inadequate for unbalanced systems, a typical case in smart grids, as they do not account for either the noncircularity of Clarke's \alpha \beta-voltage in unbalanced conditions or the correlated nature of nodal disturbances. We illuminate the relationship between the degree of circularity of Clarke's voltage and system imbalance, and prove that the proposed widely linear estimators are optimal for such conditions, while also accounting for the correlated and noncircular nature of real-world nodal disturbances. {Synthetic and real world} case studies over a range of power system conditions illustrate the theoretical and practical advantages of the proposed methodology.",1,Distributed Widely Linear Frequency Estimation in Unbalanced Three Phase  Power Systems
"Due to various green initiatives, renewable energy will be massively incorporated into the future smart grid. However, the intermittency of the renewables may result in power imbalance, thus adversely affecting the stability of a power system. Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the power balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may be connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation of EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However, V2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently. Thus it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a preliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network, whose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and regulation-down, separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can be used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the grid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we extend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism which can adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the actual system follow the analytical model.",1,Capacity Estimation for Vehicle-to-Grid Frequency Regulation Services  with Smart Charging Mechanism

"We analyze the convergence aspects of the invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF), when the latter is used as a deterministic non-linear observer on Lie groups, for continuous-time systems with discrete observations. One of the main features of invariant observers for left-invariant systems on Lie groups is that the estimation error is autonomous. In this paper we first generalize this result by characterizing the (much broader) class of systems for which this property holds. Then, we leverage the result to prove for those systems the local stability of the IEKF around any trajectory, under the standard conditions of the linear case. One mobile robotics example and one inertial navigation example illustrate the interest of the approach. Simulations evidence the fact that the EKF is capable of diverging in some challenging situations, where the IEKF with identical tuning keeps converging.",1,The invariant extended Kalman filter as a stable observer
"Most current results on coverage control using mobile sensors require that one partitioned cell is the sole responsibility of one sensor. In this paper, we consider a class of generalized Voronoi coverage control problems by using higher order Voronoi partitions, motivated by applications that more than one senor is required to monitor and cover onecell. We introduce a framework depending on a coverage performance function incorporating higher order Voronoi cells and then design a gradient-based controller which allows the multi-sensor system to achieve a local equilibrium in a distributed manner. In addition, we provide a number of real world scenarios where our framework can be applied. Simulation results are also provided to show the controller performance.",1,Higher order Voronoi based mobile coverage control
"We consider the problem of fusing measurements from multiple sensors, where the sensing regions overlap and data are non-negative---possibly resulting from a count of indistinguishable discrete entities. Because of overlaps, it is, in general, impossible to fuse this information to arrive at an accurate estimate of the overall amount or count of material present in the union of the sensing regions. Here we study the range of overall values consistent with the data. Posed as a linear programming problem, this leads to interesting questions associated with the geometry of the sensor regions, specifically, the arrangement of their non-empty intersections. We define a computational tool called the fusion polytope and derive a condition for this to be in the positive orthant thus simplifying calculations. We show that, in two dimensions, inflated tiling schemes based on rectangular regions fail to satisfy this condition, whereas inflated tiling schemes based on hexagons do.",1,Bounds on Multiple Sensor Fusion
A controllable network can be driven from any initial state to any desired state using driver nodes. A set of driver nodes to control a network is not unique. It is important to characterize these driver nodes and select the right driver nodes. The work discusses theory and algorithms to select driver node such that largest region of attraction can be obtained considering limited capacity of driver node and with unstable eigenvalues of adjacency matrix. A network which can be controllable using one driver node is considered. Nonuniqueness of driver node poses a challenge to select right driver node when multiple possibilities exist. The work addresses this issue.,1,Characterization of Driver Nodes of Anti-Stable Networks
"Uncoordinated charging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have a negative impact on the secure and economic operation of the power system, especially at the distribution level. Given that the charging load of EVs can be controlled to some extent, research on the optimal charging control of EVs has been extensively carried out. In this paper, two possible smart charging scenarios in China are studied: centralized optimal charging operated by an aggregator and decentralized optimal charging managed by individual users. Under the assumption that the aggregators and individual users only concern the economic benefits, new load peaks will arise under time of use (TOU) pricing which is extensively employed in China. To solve this problem, a simple incentive mechanism is proposed for centralized optimal charging while a rolling-update pricing scheme is devised for decentralized optimal charging. The original optimal charging models are modified to account for the developed schemes. Simulated tests corroborate the efficacy of optimal scheduling for charging EVs in various scenarios.",1,Optimal Scheduling of Electric Vehicles Charging in low-Voltage  Distribution Systems
"We consider platoons composed of identical vehicles with an asymmetric nearest-neighbor interaction. We restrict ourselves to intervehicular coupling realized with dynamic arbitrary-order onboard controllers such that the coupling to the immediately preceding vehicle is proportional to the coupling to the immediately following vehicle. Each vehicle is modeled using a transfer function and we impose no restriction on the order of the vehicle. The platoon is described by a transfer function in a convenient product form. We investigate how the H-infinity norm and the steady-state gain of the platoon scale with the number of vehicles. We conclude that if the open-loop transfer function of the vehicle contains two or more integrators and the Fiedler eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is uniformly bounded from below, the norm scales exponentially with the growing distance in the graph. If there is just one integrator in the open loop, we give a condition under which the norm of the transfer function is bounded by its steady-state gain - the platoon is string-stable. Moreover, we argue that in this case it is always possible to design a controller the predecessor following strategy.",1,Scaling in bidirectional platoons with dynamic controllers and  proportional asymmetry

Instead, we consider 'used' Li-ion batteries for this application, finding experimentally that many discarded laptop cells, for example, still have good capacity and cycle life. In order to make safe and optimal use of such cells, we present a modular power management system using a separate power converter for every cell. This novel approach allows individual batteries to be used to their full capacity. The power converters operate in voltage droop control mode to provide easy charge balancing and implement a battery management system to estimate the capacity of each cell, as we demonstrate experimentally.",1,Modular converter system for low-cost off-grid energy storage using  second life Li-ion batteries

We focus on discrete-time, stochastic linear dynamics and specifications given as formulas of the Generalized Reactivity(1) fragment of Linear Temporal Logic over linear predicates in the states of the system. We propose a solution based on iterative abstraction-refinement, and turn-based 2-player probabilistic games. While the theoretical guarantee of our algorithm after any finite number of iterations is only a partial solution, we show that if our algorithm terminates, then the result is the set of satisfying initial states. Moreover, for any (partial) solution our algorithm synthesizes witness control strategies to ensure almost-sure satisfaction of the temporal logic specification. We demonstrate our approach on an illustrative case study.",1,Temporal Logic Control for Stochastic Linear Systems using Abstraction  Refinement of Probabilistic Games

We illustrate the approach by 3-dimensional motion control applications.",1,Integral Control on Lie Groups
"This paper presents a new black-box technique for modeling long term memory effects in radio frequency power amplifiers. The proposed technique extends commonly used behavioral models by utilizing parameters that dynamically change depending on a long term memory effect while keeping the original model structure intact. This enables us to accurately track and model transient changes in power amplifier characteristics that vary slowly and are induced by the input signal.  Identification of long term memory effects is discussed and an iterative identification algorithm for the model parameters is proposed. The model is experimentally tested on a 100 Watt Doherty power amplifier with a 4 MHz Gaussian noise signal that has a step--like change in the amplitude, representative of a realistic communication signal with bursty behavior and a 20 MHz 3GPP LTE test data. Results of behavioral modeling show a 2-2.5 dB and 5-6 dB improvement in average and peak NMSE modeling performance respectively, which shows the suitability of the technique to model bursty signals.",1,Black-box Modeling and Compensation of Bursty Communication Signals in  RF Power Amplifiers with Power-Dependent Parameters

"This paper investigates the stability of Kalman filtering over Gilbert-Elliott channels where random packet drop follows a time-homogeneous two-state Markov chain whose state transition is determined by a pair of failure and recovery rates. First of all, we establish a relaxed condition guaranteeing peak-covariance stability described by an inequality in terms of the spectral radius of the system matrix and transition probabilities of the Markov chain. We further show that that condition can be interpreted using a linear matrix inequality feasibility problem. Next, we prove that the peak-covariance stability implies mean-square stability, if the system matrix has no defective eigenvalues on the unit circle. This connection between the two stability notions holds for any random packet drop process. We prove that there exists a critical curve in the failure-recovery rate plane, below which the Kalman filter is mean-square stable and no longer mean-square stable above, via a coupling method in stochastic processes. Finally, a lower bound for this critical failure rate is obtained making use of the relationship we establish between the two stability criteria, based on an approximate relaxation of the system matrix.",1,Kalman Filtering over Gilbert-Elliott Channels: Stability Conditions and  the Critical Curve
"This paper studies the problem of interacting multiple model (IMM) estimation for jump Markov linear systems with unknown measurement noise covariance. The system state and the unknown covariance are jointly estimated in the framework of Bayesian estimation, where the unknown covariance is modeled as a random matrix according to an inverse-Wishart distribution. For the IMM estimation with random matrices, one difficulty encountered is the combination of a set of weighted inverse-Wishart distributions. Instead of using the moment matching approach, this difficulty is overcome by minimizing the weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence for inverse-Wishart distributions. It is shown that a closed form solution can be derived for the optimization problem and the resulting solution coincides with an inverse-Wishart distribution.

"This paper presents a UAV-based optimal crop-dusting method to control anomalously diffusing infestation of crops. Two anomalous diffusion models are considered, which are, respectively, time-fractional order diffusion equation and space-fractional order diffusion equation. Our problem formulation is motivated by real-time pest management by using networked unmanned cropdusters where the pest spreading is modeled as a fractional diffusion equation. We attempt to solve the optimal dynamic location of actuators by using Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations. A new simulation platform (FO-DiffMAS-2D) for measurement scheduling and controls in fractional order distributed parameter systems is also introduced in this paper.

"Semi-active suspensions have drawn particular attention due to their superior performance over the other types of suspensions. One of their advantages is that their damping coefficient can be controlled without the need for any external source of power. In this study, three control approaches are implemented on a quarter-car model using MATLAB/Simulink. The investigated control methodologies are Acceleration Driven Damper, Power Driven Damper, and H_infinity Robust Control. The three controllers are known as comfort-oriented approaches. H_infinity Robust Control is an advanced method that guarantees transient performance and rejects external disturbances. It is shown that H_infinity with the proposed modification, has the best performance although its relatively high cost of computation could be potentially considered as a drawback.",1,Semi-active Suspension Control using Modern Methodology: Comprehensive  Comparison Study
"This paper proposes a strategy to estimate the velocity and position of neighbor agents using distance measurements only. Since with agents executing arbitrary motions, instantaneous distance-only measurements cannot provide enough information for our objectives, we postulate that agents engage in a combination of circular motion and linear motion. The proposed estimator can be used to develop control algorithms where only distance measurements are available to each agent. As an example, we show how this estimation method can be used to control the formation shape and velocity of the agents in a multi agent system. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",1,Simultaneous Velocity and Position Estimation via Distance-only  Measurements with Application to Multi-Agent System Control
The Kaczmarz algorithm (KA) is a popular method for solving a system of linear equations. In this note we derive a new exponential convergence result for the KA. The key allowing us to establish the new result is to rewrite the KA in such a way that its solution path can be interpreted as the output from a particular dynamical system. The asymptotic stability results of the corresponding dynamical system can then be leveraged to prove exponential convergence of the KA. The new bound is also compared to existing bounds.,1,On the exponential convergence of the Kaczmarz algorithm

"Phase-locked loops (PLL), Costas loops and other synchronizing circuits are featured by the presence of a nonlinear phase detector, described by a periodic nonlinearity. In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the system such multi-stability and chaos. However, even phase locking may be guaranteed under any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit can be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error caused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and decoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error oscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits extremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in this direction, available in the literature, examine the probability density of the phase error and expected number of slipped cycles under stochastic noise in the signal. At the same time, cycle slipping occurs also in deterministic systems with periodic nonlinearities, depending on the initial conditions, properties of the linear part and the periodic nonlinearity and other factors such as delays in the loop. In the present paper we give analytic estimates for the number of slipped cycles in PLL-based systems, governed by integro-differential equations, allowing to capture effects of high-order dynamics, discrete and distributed delays. We also consider the effects of singular small parameter perturbations on the cycle slipping behavior.",1,Cycle slipping in nonlinear circuits under periodic nonlinearities and  time delays
"Many systems, arising in electrical and electronic engineering are based on controlled phase synchronization of several periodic processes (phase synchronization systems, or PSS). Typically such systems are featured by the gradient-like behavior, i.e. the system has infinite sequence of equilibria points, and any solution converges to one of them. This property however says nothing about the transient behavior of the system, whose important qualitative index is the maximal phase error. The synchronous regime of gradient-like system may be preceded by cycle slipping, i.e. the increase of the absolute phase error. Since the cycle slipping is considered to be undesired behavior of PSSs, it is important to find efficient estimates for the number of slipped cycles. In the present paper, we address the problem of cycle-slipping for phase synchronization systems described by integro-differential Volterra equations with a small parameter at the higher derivative. New effective estimates for a number of slipped cycles are obtained by means of Popov's method of a priori integral indices. The estimates are uniform with respect to the small parameter.",1,Estimation of transient process for singularly perturbed synchronization  system with distributed parameters
"Increasing shares of fluctuating renewable energy sources induce higher and higher power flow variability at the transmission level. The question arises as to what extent existing networks can absorb additional fluctuating power injection without exceeding thermal limits. At the same time, the resulting power flow characteristics call for revisiting classical approaches to line temperature prediction. This paper presents a probabilistic modeling and simulation methodology for estimating the occurrence of critical line temperatures in the presence of fluctuating power flows. Cumbersome integration of the dynamic thermal equations at each Monte Carlo simulation trial is sped up by a specific algorithm that makes use of a variance reduction technique adapted from the telecommunications field. The substantial reduction in computational time allows estimations closer to real time, relevant to short-term operational assessments. A case study performed on a single line model provides fundamental insights into the probability of hitting critical line temperatures under given power flow fluctuations. A transmission system application shows how the proposed method can be used for a fast yet accurate operational assessment.",1,Probabilistic Modeling and Simulation of Transmission Line Temperatures  under Fluctuating Power Flows
"This paper is concerned with the optimal approximation of a given multivariate Dirac mixture, i.e., a density comprising weighted Dirac distributions on a continuous domain, by an equally weighted Dirac mixture with a reduced number of components. The parameters of the approximating density are calculated by minimizing a smooth global distance measure, a generalization of the well-known Cram\'{e}r-von Mises Distance to the multivariate case. This generalization is achieved by defining an alternative to the classical cumulative distribution, the Localized Cumulative Distribution (LCD), as a characterization of discrete random quantities (on continuous domains), which is unique and symmetric also in the multivariate case. The resulting approximation method provides the basis for various efficient nonlinear state and parameter estimation methods.",1,Optimal Reduction of Multivariate Dirac Mixture Densities
"The rapid depletion of fossil fuel resources and environmental concerns has given awareness on generation of renewable energy resources. Among the various renewable resources, hybrid solar and wind energy seems to be promising solutions to provide reliable power supply with improved system efficiency and reduced storage requirements for stand-alone applications. This paper presents a feasibility assessment and optimum size of photovoltaic (PV) array, wind turbine and battery bank for a standalone hybrid Solar/Wind Power system (HSWPS) at remote telecom station of Nepal at Latitude (27{\deg}23'50) and Longitude (86{\deg}44'23) consisting a telecommunication load of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT), Repeater station and Code Division Multiple Access Base Transceiver Station (CDMA 2C10 BTS). In any RES based system, the feasibility assessment is considered as the first step analysis. In this work, feasibility analysis is carried through hybrid optimization model for electric renewables (HOMER) and mathematical models were implemented in the MATLAB environment to perform the optimal configuration for a given load and a desired loss of power supply probability (LPSP) from a set of systems components with the lowest value of cost function defined in terms of reliability and levelized unit electricity cost (LUCE).

"Synchronization underlies phenomena including memory and perception in the brain, coordinated motion of animal flocks, and stability of the power grid. These synchronization phenomena are often modeled through networks of phase-coupled oscillating nodes. Heterogeneity in the node dynamics, however, may prevent such networks from achieving the required level of synchronization. In order to guarantee synchronization, external inputs can be used to pin a subset of nodes to a reference frequency, while the remaining nodes are steered toward synchronization via local coupling. In this paper, we present a submodular optimization framework for selecting a set of nodes to act as external inputs in order to achieve synchronization from almost any initial network state. We derive threshold-based sufficient conditions for synchronization, and then prove that these conditions are equivalent to connectivity of a class of augmented network graphs. Based on this connection, we map the sufficient conditions for synchronization to constraints on submodular functions, leading to efficient algorithms with provable optimality bounds for selecting input nodes. We illustrate our approach via numerical studies of synchronization in networks from power systems, wireless networks, and neuronal networks.",1,Global Practical Node and Edge Synchronization in Kuramoto Networks: A  Submodular Optimization Framework
"When power grids are heavily stressed with a bulk power transfer, it is useful to have a fast indication of the increased stress when multiple line outages occur. Reducing the bulk power transfer when the outages are severe could forestall further cascading of the outages. We show that synchrophasor measurements of voltage angles at all the area tie lines can be used to indicate the severity of multiple outages. These synchrophasor measurements are readily combined into an area angle that can quickly track the severity of multiple outages after they occur. We present a procedure to define thresholds for the area angle that relate to the maximum power that can be transferred through the area until a line limit is reached. Then in real time we would monitor the area angle and compare it to the thresholds when line outages occur to determine the urgency (or not) of actions to reduce the bulk transfer of power through the area. The procedure also identifies exceptional cases in which separate actions to resolve local power distribution problems are needed. We illustrate the thresholds and monitoring with the area angle across several states of Northwestern USA.",1,Threshold-based monitoring of cascading outages with PMU measurements of  area angle
"We propose an encoding and control strategy for the stabilization of switched systems with limited information, supposing the controller is given for each mode. Only the quantized output and the active mode of the plant at each sampling time are transmitted to the controller. Due to switching, the active mode of the plant may be different from that of the controller in the closed-loop system. Hence if switching occurs, the quantizer must recalculate a bounded set containing the estimation error for quantization at the next sampling time. We establish the global asymptotic stability under a slow-switching assumption on dwell time and average dwell time. To this end, we construct multiple discrete-time Lyapunov functions with respect to the estimated state and the size of the bounded set.",1,Output Feedback Stabilization of Switched Linear Systems with Limited  Information

"Vehicular energy network (VEN) is a vehicular network which can transport energy over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs). In the near future, an abundance of EVs, plentiful generation of the renewables, and mature wireless energy transfer and vehicular communication technologies will expedite the realization of VEN. To transmit energy from a source to a destination, we need to establish energy paths, which are composed of segments of vehicular routes, while satisfying various design objectives. In this paper, we develop a method to construct all energy paths for a particular energy source-destination pair, followed by some analytical results of the method. We describe how to utilize the energy paths to develop optimization models for different design goals and propose two solutions. We also develop a heuristic for the power loss minimization problem.

"Hypothesis testing methods that do not rely on exact distribution assumptions have been emerging lately. The method of sign-perturbed sums (SPS) is capable of characterizing confidence regions with exact confidence levels for linear regression and linear dynamical systems parameter estimation problems if the noise distribution is symmetric. This paper describes a general family of hypothesis testing methods that have an exact user chosen confidence level based on finite sample count and without relying on an assumed noise distribution. It is shown that the SPS method belongs to this family and we provide another hypothesis test for the case where the symmetry assumption is replaced with exchangeability. In the case of linear regression problems it is shown that the confidence regions are connected, bounded and possibly non-convex sets in both cases. To highlight the importance of understanding the structure of confidence regions corresponding to such hypothesis tests it is shown that confidence sets for linear dynamical systems parameter estimates generated using the SPS method can have non-connected parts, which have far reaching consequences.",1,Perturbed Datasets Methods for Hypothesis Testing and Structure of  Corresponding Confidence Sets

"This paper considers the real-time power quality monitoring in power grid systems. The goal is to detect the occurrence of disturbances in the nominal sinusoidal voltage/current signal as quickly as possible such that protection measures can be taken in time. Based on an autoregressive (AR) model for the disturbance, we propose a generalized local likelihood ratio (GLLR) detector which processes meter readings sequentially and alarms as soon as the test statistic exceeds a prescribed threshold. The proposed detector not only reacts to a wide range of disturbances, but also achieves lower detection delay compared to the conventional block processing method. Then we further propose to deploy multiple meters to monitor the power signal cooperatively. The distributed meters communicate wirelessly to a central meter, where the data fusion and detection are performed. In light of the limited bandwidth of wireless channels, we develop a level-triggered sampling scheme, where each meter transmits only one-bit each time asynchronously. The proposed multi-meter scheme features substantially low communication overhead, while its performance is close to that of the ideal case where distributed meter readings are perfectly available at the central meter.",1,Cooperative Change Detection for Online Power Quality Monitoring
"Over the last few years, sampling-based stochastic optimal control (SOC) frameworks have shown impressive performances in reinforcement learning (RL) with applications in robotics. However, such approaches require a large amount of samples from many interactions with the physical systems. To improve learning efficiency, we present a novel model-based and data-driven SOC framework based on path integral formulation and Gaussian processes (GPs). The proposed approach learns explicit and time-varying optimal controls autonomously from limited sampled data. Based on this framework, we propose an iterative control scheme with improved applicability in higher-dimensional and more complex control tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework using two nontrivial examples. Compared to state-of-the-art RL methods, the proposed framework features superior control learning efficiency.",1,Model-based Path Integral Stochastic Control: A Bayesian Nonparametric  Approach
"In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the identification of Hammerstein systems. Adopting a Bayesian approach, we model the impulse response of the unknown linear dynamic system as a realization of a zero-mean Gaussian process. The covariance matrix (or kernel) of this process is given by the recently introduced stable-spline kernel, which encodes information on the stability and regularity of the impulse response. The static non-linearity of the model is identified using an Empirical Bayes approach, i.e. by maximizing the output marginal likelihood, which is obtained by integrating out the unknown impulse response. The related optimization problem is solved adopting a novel iterative scheme based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method, where each iteration consists in a simple sequence of update rules. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with a standard algorithm for Hammerstein system identification.",1,A kernel-based approach to Hammerstein system identification
"An advanced system of sensors/actuators should allow the direct feedback of a sensed signal into an actuation, e.g., an action potential propagation through an axon or a special cell activity might be sensed and suppressed by an actuator through voltage stimulation or chemical delivery. Such a complex procedure of sensing and stimulation calls for direct communication among these sensors and actuators. In addition, minimizing the sensor/actuator to the size of a biological cell can enable the cell-level automatic therapy. For this objective, we propose such an approach to form a peer-to-peer network of \emph{in vivo} sensors/actuators (S/As) that can be deployed with or even inside biological cells. The S/As can communicate with each other via electromagnetic waves of optical frequencies. In comparison with the comparable techniques including the radio-frequency identification (RFID) and the wireless sensor network (WSN), this technique is well adapted for the cell-level sensing-actuating tasks considering the requirements on size, actuation speed, signal-collision avoidance, etc.",1,In-vivo Network of Sensors and Actuators
"In this paper, we study the consensus problem for continuous-time and discrete-time multi-agent systems in state-dependent switching networks. In each case, we first consider the networks with fixed connectivity, in which the communication between adjacent agents always exists but the influence could possibly become negligible if the transmission distance is long enough. It is obtained that consensus can be reached under a restriction of either the decaying rate of the transmission weight or the initial states of the agents. After then we investigate the networks with state-dependent connectivity, in which the information transmission between adjacent agents gradually vanishes if their distance exceeds a fixed range. In such networks, we prove that the realization of consensus requires the validity of some initial conditions. Finally, the conclusions are applied to models with the transmission law of C-S model, opinion dynamics and the rendezvous problem, the corresponding simulations are also presented.",1,Consensus of Multi-agent Systems Under State-dependent Information  Transmission

"In this paper, we investigate a decentralized formation control algorithm for an undirected formation control model. Unlike other formation control problems where only the shape of a configuration counts, we emphasize here also its Euclidean embedding. By following this decentralized formation control law, the agents will converge to certain equilibrium of the control system. In particular, we show that there is a quadratic Lyapunov function associated with the formation control system whose unique local (global) minimum point is the target configuration. In view of the fact that there exist multiple equilibria (in fact, a continuum of equilibria) of the formation control system, and hence there are solutions of the system which converge to some equilibria other than the target configuration, we apply simulated annealing, as a heuristic method, to the formation control law to fix this problem. Simulation results show that sample paths of the modified stochastic system approach the target configuration.",1,Decentralized Formation Control with A Quadratic Lyapunov Function
"In this paper, we investigate the controllability of a class of formation control systems. Given a directed graph, we assign an agent to each of its vertices and let the edges of the graph describe the information flow in the system. We relate the strongly connected components of this graph to the reachable set of the formation control system. Moreover, we show that the formation control model is approximately path-controllable over a path-connected, open dense subset as long as the graph is weakly connected and satisfies some mild assumption on the numbers of vertices of the strongly connected components.",1,Controllability of Formations over Time-varying Graphs
"Gradient descent methods have been widely used for organizing multi-agent systems, in which they can provide decentralized control laws with provable convergence. Often, the control laws are designed so that two neighboring agents repel/attract each other at a short/long distance of separation. When the interactions between neighboring agents are moreover nonfading, the potential function from which they are derived is radially unbounded. Hence, the LaSalle's principle is sufficient to establish the system convergence. This paper investigates, in contrast, a more realistic scenario where interactions between neighboring agents have fading attractions. In such setting, the LaSalle type arguments may not be sufficient. To tackle the problem, we introduce a class of partitions, termed dilute partitions, of formations which cluster agents according to the inter- and intra-cluster interaction strengths. We then apply dilute partitions to trajectories of formations generated by the multi-agent system, and show that each of the trajectories remains bounded along the evolution, and converges to the set of equilibria.",1,Swarm Aggregation under Fading Attractions
"In this paper, we establish a few new synchronization conditions for complex networks with nonlinear and nonidentical self-dynamics with switching directed communication graphs. In light of the recent works on distributed sub-gradient methods, we impose integral convexity for the nonlinear node self-dynamics in the sense that the self-dynamics of a given node is the gradient of some concave function corresponding to that node. The node couplings are assumed to be linear but with switching directed communication graphs. Several sufficient and/or necessary conditions are established for exact or approximate synchronization over the considered complex networks. These results show when and how nonlinear node self-dynamics may cooperate with the linear diffusive coupling, which eventually leads to network synchronization conditions under relaxed connectivity requirements.",1,Network Synchronization with Convexity
"We propose a distributed algorithm for time synchronization in mobile wireless sensor networks. Each node can employ the algorithm to estimate the global time based on its local clock time. The problem of time synchronization is formulated as nodes estimating their skews and offsets from noisy difference measurements of offsets and logarithm of skews; the measurements acquired by time-stamped message exchanges between neighbors. A distributed stochastic approximation based algorithm is proposed to ensure that the estimation error is mean square convergent (variance converging to 0) under certain conditions. A sequence of scheduled update instants is used to meet the requirement of decreasing time-varying gains that need to be synchronized across nodes with unsynchronized clocks. Moreover, a modification on the algorithm is also presented to improve the initial convergence speed. Simulations indicate that highly accurate global time estimates can be achieved with the proposed algorithm for long time durations, while the errors in competing algorithms increase over time.",1,Accurate Distributed Time Synchronization in Mobile Wireless Sensor  Networks from Noisy Difference Measurements

"The transport and continuum equations exhibit a number of conservation laws. For example, scalar multiplication is conserved by the transport equation, while positivity of probabilities is conserved by the continuum equation. Certain discretization techniques, such as particle based methods, conserve these properties, but converge slower than spectral discretization methods on smooth data. Standard spectral discretization methods, on the other hand, do not conserve the invariants of the transport equation and the continuum equation. This article constructs a novel spectral discretization technique that conserves these important invariants while simultaneously preserving spectral convergence rates. The performance of this proposed method is illustrated on several numerical experiments.",1,Qualitatively accurate spectral schemes for advection and transport

"There has been an increasing trend in the electric power system from a centralized generation-driven grid to a more reliable, environmental friendly, and customer-driven grid. One of the most important issues which the designers of smart grids need to deal with is to forecast the fluctuations of power demand and generation in order to make the power system facilities more flexible to the variable nature of renewable power resources and demand-side. This paper proposes a novel two-tier scheme for forecasting the power demand and generation in a general residential electrical gird which uses the distributed renewable resources as the primary energy resource. The proposed forecasting scheme has two tiers: long-term demand/generation forecaster which is based on Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and real-time demand/generation forecaster which is based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving-Average (ARIMA) model. The paper also shows that how bulk generation improves the adequacy of proposed residential system by canceling-out the forecasters estimation errors which are in the form of Gaussian White noises.",1,Optimal Two-Tier Forecasting Power Generation Model in Smart Grids
"This paper develops efficient algorithms for distributed average consensus with quantized communication using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We first study the effects of probabilistic and deterministic quantizations on a distributed ADMM algorithm. With probabilistic quantization, this algorithm yields linear convergence to the desired average in the mean sense with a bounded variance. When deterministic quantization is employed, the distributed ADMM either converges to a consensus or cycles with a finite period after a finite-time iteration. In the cyclic case, local quantized variables have the same mean over one period and hence each node can also reach a consensus. We then obtain an upper bound on the consensus error which depends only on the quantization resolution and the average degree of the network. Finally, we propose a two-stage algorithm which combines both probabilistic and deterministic quantizations. Simulations show that the two-stage algorithm, without picking small algorithm parameter, has consensus errors that are typically less than one quantization resolution for all connected networks where agents' data can be of arbitrary magnitudes.",1,Quantized Consensus by the ADMM: Probabilistic versus Deterministic  Quantizers
"A consensus system is a linear multi-agent system in which agents communicate to reach a so-called consensus state, defined as the average of the initial states of the agents. Consider a more generalized situation in which each agent is given a positive weight and the consensus state is defined as the weighted average of the initial conditions. We characterize in this paper the weighted averages that can be evaluated in a decentralized way by agents communicating over a directed graph. Specifically, we introduce a linear function, called the objective map, that defines the desired final state as a function of the initial states of the agents. We then provide a complete answer to the question of whether there is a decentralized consensus dynamics over a given digraph which converges to the final state specified by an objective map. In particular, we characterize not only the set of objective maps that are feasible for a given digraph, but also the consensus dynamics that implements the objective map. In addition, we present a decentralized algorithm to design the consensus dynamics.",1,Consensus with Linear Objective Maps

"Rigidity theory enables us to specify the conditions of unique localizability in the cooperative localization problem of wireless sensor networks. This paper presents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and (ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through graph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We define the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of edges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates how close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global rigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover, redundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems against structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader definition of redundant edge that we call the generalized redundant edge. This definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs. Next, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized redundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices allow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the transition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided to demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two indices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the rigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the localizability of sensor networks. We evaluate the required changes in sensing radii for localizability by means of the rigidity index and the redundancy index using random geometric graphs in simulations.",1,Graph invariants for unique localizability in cooperative localization  of wireless sensor networks: rigidity index and redundancy index
"Magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) is a practically appealing method for realizing the near-field wireless power transfer (WPT). The MRC-WPT system with a single pair of transmitter and receiver has been extensively studied in the literature, while there is limited work on the general setup with multiple transmitters and/or receivers. In this paper, we consider a point-to-multipoint MRC-WPT system with one transmitter sending power wirelessly to a set of distributed receivers simultaneously. We derive the power delivered to the load of each receiver in closed-form expression, and reveal a near-far fairness issue in multiuser power transmission due to users' distance-dependent mutual inductances with the transmitter. We also show that by designing the receivers' load resistances, the near-far issue can be optimally solved. Specifically, we propose a centralized algorithm to jointly optimize the load resistances to minimize the power drawn from the energy source at the transmitter under given power requirements for the loads. We also devise a distributed algorithm for the receivers to adjust their load resistances iteratively, for ease of practical implementation.",1,Multiuser Charging Control in Wireless Power Transfer via Magnetic  Resonant Coupling

The relationship between the Kalman filter and the adversary can be regarded as a two-person zero-sum game. Under which condition both sides of the game will reach the Nash equilibrium is investigated in the paper. The multi-sensor Kalman filter system and the adversary are supposed to be rational players. The Kalman filter and the adversary have to choose their respective subsets of sensors to perform system state estimation and false information injection. It is shown how both sides pick their strategies in order to gain more and lose less. The optimal solutions are achieved by solving the minimax problem. Numerical results are also provided in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived optimal strategies.",1,A State Estimation and Malicious Attack Game in Multi-Sensor Dynamic  Systems
"In this paper, we propose and study the effectiveness of customer engagement plans that clearly specify the amount of intervention in customer's load settings by the grid operator for peak load reduction. We suggest two different types of plans, including Constant Deviation Plans (CDPs) and Proportional Deviation Plans (PDPs). We define an adjustable reference temperature for both CDPs and PDPs to limit the output temperature of each thermostat load and to control the number of devices eligible to participate in Demand Response Program (DRP). We model thermostat loads as power throttling devices and design algorithms to evaluate the impact of power throttling states and plan parameters on peak load reduction. Based on the simulation results, we recommend PDPs to the customers of a residential community with variable thermostat set point preferences, while CDPs are suitable for customers with similar thermostat set point preferences. If thermostat loads have multiple power throttling states, customer engagement plans with less temperature deviations from thermostat set points are recommended. Contrary to classical ON/OFF control, higher temperature deviations are required to achieve similar amount of peak load reduction. Several other interesting tradeoffs and useful guidelines for designing mutually beneficial incentives for both the grid operator and customers can also be identified.",1,Customer Engagement Plans for Peak Load Reduction in Residential Smart  Grids
"This paper contains a concise comparison of a number of nonlinear attitude filtering methods that have attracted attention in the robotics and aviation literature. With the help of previously published surveys and comparison studies, the vast literature on the subject is narrowed down to a small pool of competitive attitude filters. Amongst these filters is a second-order optimal minimum-energy filter recently proposed by the authors. Easily comparable discretized unit quaternion implementations of the selected filters are provided. We conduct a simulation study and compare the transient behaviour and asymptotic convergence of these filters in two scenarios with different initialization and measurement errors inspired by applications in unmanned aerial robotics and space flight. The second-order optimal minimum-energy filter is shown to have the best performance of all filters, including the industry standard multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF).",1,Nonlinear Attitude Filtering: A Comparison Study
"This paper considers the leader-follower tracking control problem for linear interconnected systems with undirected topology and linear dynamic coupling. Interactions between the systems are treated as linear dynamic uncertainty and are described in terms of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A consensus-type tracking control protocol is proposed for each system based on its state relative its neighbors. In addition a selected set of subsystems uses for control their relative states with respect to the leader. Two methods are proposed for the design of this control protocol. One method uses a coordinate transformation to recast the protocol design problem as a decentralized robust control problem for an auxiliary interconnected large scale system. Another method is direct, it does not employ coordinate transformation; it also allows for more general linear uncertain interactions. Using these methods, sufficient conditions are obtained which guarantee that the system tracks the leader. These conditions guarantee a suboptimal bound on the system consensus and tracking performance. The proposed methods are compared using a simulation example, and their effectiveness is discussed. Also, algorithms are proposed for computing suboptimal controllers.",1,Leader-follower Tracking Control with Guaranteed Consensus Performance  for Interconnected Systems with Linear Dynamic Uncertain Coupling
The class of radial fuzzy systems is introduced. The fuzzy systems in this class use radial functions to implement membership functions of fuzzy sets and exhibit a shape preservation property in antecedents of their rules. The property is called the radial property. It enables the radial fuzzy systems to have their computational model mathematically tractable under both conjunctive and implicative representations of their rule bases. Coherence of radial implicative fuzzy systems is discussed and a sufficient condition for coherence is stated.,1,Radial Fuzzy Systems
This paper proposes a general framework for probabilistic certification of cancer therapies. The certification is defined in terms of two key issues which are the tumor contraction and the lower admissible bound on the circulating lymphocytes which is viewed as indicator of the patient health. The certification is viewed as the ability to guarantee with a predefined high probability the success of the therapy over a finite horizon despite of the unavoidable high uncertainties affecting the dynamic model that is used to compute the optimal scheduling of drugs injection. The certification paradigm can be viewed as a tool for tuning the treatment parameters and protocols as well as for getting a rational use of limited or expensive drugs. The proposed framework is illustrated using the specific problem of combined immunotherapy/chemotherapy of cancer.,1,On Probabilistic Certification of Combined Cancer Therapies Using  Strongly Uncertain Models
"The kinetic battery model is a popular model of the dynamic behavior of a conventional battery, useful to predict or optimize the time until battery depletion. The model however lacks certain obvious aspects of batteries in-the-wild, especially with respect to (i) the effects of random influences and (ii) the behavior when charging up to capacity bounds. This paper considers the kinetic battery model with bounded capacity in the context of piecewise constant yet random charging and discharging. The resulting model enables the time-dependent evaluation of the risk of battery depletion. This is exemplified in a power dependability study of a nano satellite mission.",1,Recharging Probably Keeps Batteries Alive
"Technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is getting mature and many AVs will appear on the roads in the near future. AVs become connected with the support of various vehicular communication technologies and they possess high degree of control to respond to instantaneous situations cooperatively with high efficiency and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a new public transportation system based on AVs. It manages a fleet of AVs to accommodate transportation requests, offering point-to-point services with ride sharing. We focus on the two major problems of the system: scheduling and admission control. The former is to configure the most economical schedules and routes for the AVs to satisfy the admissible requests while the latter is to determine the set of admissible requests among all requests to produce maximum profit. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program and the admission control problem is cast as a bilevel optimization, which embeds the scheduling problem as the major constraint. By utilizing the analytical properties of the problem, we develop an effective genetic-algorithm-based method to tackle the admission control problem. We validate the performance of the algorithm with real-world transportation service data.",1,Autonomous Vehicle Public Transportation System: Scheduling and  Admission Control
"This paper presents a data-driven receding horizon fault estimation method for additive actuator and sensor faults in unknown linear time-invariant systems, with enhanced robustness to stochastic identification errors. State-of-the-art methods construct fault estimators with identified state-space models or Markov parameters, but they do not compensate for identification errors. Motivated by this limitation, we first propose a receding horizon fault estimator parameterized by predictor Markov parameters. This estimator provides (asymptotically) unbiased fault estimates as long as the subsystem from faults to outputs has no unstable transmission zeros. When the identified Markov parameters are used to construct the above fault estimator, zero-mean stochastic identification errors appear as model uncertainty multiplied with unknown fault signals and online system inputs/outputs (I/O). Based on this fault estimation error analysis, we formulate a mixed-norm problem for the offline robust design that regards online I/O data as unknown. An alternative online mixed-norm problem is also proposed that can further reduce estimation errors when the online I/O data have large amplitudes, at the cost of increased computational burden. Based on a geometrical interpretation of the two proposed mixed-norm problems, systematic methods to tune the user-defined parameters therein are given to achieve desired performance trade-offs. Simulation examples illustrate the benefits of our proposed methods compared to recent literature.",1,Data-Driven Robust Receding Horizon Fault Estimation
"This paper proposes to decouple performance optimization and enforcement of asymptotic convergence in Model Predictive Control (MPC) so that convergence to a given terminal set is achieved independently of how much performance is optimized at each sampling step. By embedding an explicit decreasing condition in the MPC constraints and thanks to a novel and very easy-to-implement convex feasibility solver proposed in the paper, it is possible to run an outer performance optimization algorithm on top of the feasibility solver and optimize for an amount of time that depends on the available CPU resources within the current sampling step (possibly going open-loop at a given sampling step in the extreme case no resources are available) and still guarantee convergence to the terminal set. While the MPC setup and the solver proposed in the paper can deal with quite general classes of functions, we highlight the synthesis method and show numerical results in case of linear MPC and ellipsoidal and polyhedral terminal sets.",1,A Convex Feasibility Approach to Anytime Model Predictive Control

The dynamics of the considered systems consist of two components. An appropriate feedback law which guarantees that certain performance requirements (eg. connectivity) are preserved and induces the coupled constraints and additional free inputs which we exploit in order to accomplish high level tasks.

In each link, networking effects such as the transmission delay, packet loss, sampling jitter and data packet miss-ordering are captured by time-varying delays. Stability analysis is carried out based on the Lyapunov Krasovskii method to obtain a condition for stability of the nonlinear NCS in the form of linear matrix inequality (LMI). The results are applied to a two degrees of freedom robot arm NCS which shows a considerable improvement with respect to the previous works.",1,Improved Stability Analysis of Nonlinear Networked Control Systems over  Multiple Communication Links

"In this paper, we use data collected from over 2000 non-residential electric vehicle supply equipments (EVSEs) located in Northern California for the year of 2013 to estimate the potential benefits of smart electric vehicle (EV) charging. We develop a smart charging framework to identify the benefits of non-residential EV charging to the load aggregators and the distribution grid. Using this extensive dataset, we aim to improve upon past studies focusing on the benefits of smart EV charging by relaxing the assumptions made in these studies regarding: (i) driving patterns, driver behavior and driver types; (ii) the scalability of a limited number of simulated vehicles to represent different load aggregation points in the power system with different customer characteristics; and (iii) the charging profile of EVs. First, we study the benefits of EV aggregations behind-the-meter, where a time-of-use pricing schema is used to understand the benefits to the owner when EV aggregations shift load from high cost periods to lower cost periods. For the year of 2013, we show a reduction of up to 24.8% in the monthly bill is possible. Then, following a similar aggregation strategy, we show that EV aggregations decrease their contribution to the system peak load by approximately 40% when charging is controlled within arrival and departure times. Our results also show that it could be expected to shift approximately 0.25kWh (~2.8%) of energy per non-residential EV charging session from peak periods (12PM-6PM) to off-peak periods (after 6PM) in Northern California for the year of 2013.",1,Estimating the Benefits of Electric Vehicle Smart Charging at  Non-Residential Locations: A Data-Driven Approach
"In this paper, we propose two novel p-norm penalty least mean square (Lp-LMS) algorithms as supplements of the conventional Lp-LMS algorithm established for sparse adaptive filtering recently. A gradient comparator is employed to selectively apply the zero attractor of p-norm constraint for only those taps that have the same polarity as that of the gradient of the squared instantaneous error, which leads to the new proposed gradient compared p-norm constraint LMS algorithm (LpGC-LMS). We explain that the LpGC-LMS can achieve lower mean square error than the standard Lp-LMS algorithm theoretically and experimentally. To further improve the performance of the filter, the LpNGC-LMS algorithm is derived using a new gradient comparator which takes the sign-smoothed version of the previous one. The performance of the LpNGC-LMS is superior to that of the LpGC-LMS in theory and in simulations. Moreover, these two comparators can be easily applied to other norm constraint LMS algorithms to derive some new approaches for sparse adaptive filtering. The numerical simulation results show that the two proposed algorithms achieve better performance than the standard LMS algorithm and Lp-LMS algorithm in terms of convergence rate and steady-state behavior in sparse system identification settings.",1,Gradient Compared Lp-LMS Algorithms for Sparse System Identification
"It is known that polynomial filtering can accelerate the convergence towards average consensus on an undirected network. In this paper the gain of a second-order filtering is investigated. A set of graphs is determined for which consensus can be attained in finite time, and a preconditioner is proposed to adapt the undirected weights of any given graph to achieve fastest convergence with the polynomial filter. The corresponding cost function differs from the traditional spectral gap, as it favors grouping the eigenvalues in two clusters. A possible loss of robustness of the polynomial filter is also highlighted.",1,Accelerating Consensus by Spectral Clustering and Polynomial Filters
"This paper proposes a new leaky least mean square (leaky LMS, LLMS) algorithm in which a norm penalty is introduced to force the solution to be sparse in the application of system identification. The leaky LMS algorithm is derived because the performance ofthe standard LMS algorithm deteriorates when the input is highly correlated. However, both ofthem do not take the sparsity information into account to yield better behaviors. As a modification ofthe LLMS algorithm, the proposed algorithm, named Lp-LLMS, incorporates a p norm penalty into the cost function ofthe LLMS to obtain a shrinkage in the weight update equation, which then enhances the performance of the filter in system identification settings, especially when the impulse response is sparse. The simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm improves the performance ofthe filter in sparse system settings in the presence ofnoisy input signals.",1,p Norm Constraint Leaky LMS Algorithm for Sparse System Identification

"Diversity of software packages to simulate the power system circuits is considerable. It is challenging to transfer power system circuit model data (PSCMD) among different software tools and rebuild the same circuit in the second software environment. This paper proposes a unified platform (UP) where PSCMD are stored in a spreadsheet file with a defined format. Script-based PSCMD transfer applications, written in MATLAB, have been developed for a set of software to read the circuit model data from the UP spreadsheet and reconstruct the circuit in the destination software. This significantly eases the process of transferring circuit model data between each pair of software tools. In this paper ETAP, OpenDSS, Grid LabD, and DEW are considered. In order to test the developed PSCMD transfer applications, circuit model data of a test circuit and an actual sample circuit from a Californian utility company, both built in CYME, were exported into the spreadsheet file according to the UP format. Thereafter, circuit model data were imported successfully from the spreadsheet files into all above mentioned software using the PSCMD transfer applications developed for each software individually. Finally, load flow analysis is performed in all software and the obtained results match with each other.",1,A Unified Platform Enabling Power System Circuit Model Data Transfer  Among Different Software
"When multiple model predictive controllers are implemented on a shared control area network (CAN), their performance may degrade due to the inhomogeneous timing and delays among messages. The priority based real-time scheduling of messages on the CAN introduces complex timing of events, especially when the types and number of messages change at runtime. This paper introduces a novel hybrid timing model to make runtime predictions on the timing of the messages for a finite time window. Controllers can be designed using the optimization algorithms for model predictive control by considering the timing as optimization constraints. This timing model allows multiple controllers to share a CAN without significant degradation in the controller performance. The timing model also provides a convenient way to check the schedulability of messages on the CAN at runtime. Simulation results demonstrate that the timing model is accurate and computationally efficient to meet the needs of real-time implementation. Simulation results also demonstrate that model predictive controllers designed when considering the timing constraints have superior performance than the controllers designed without considering the timing constraints.",1,Model Predictive Control under Timing Constraints induced by Controller  Area Networks

"The problem of quickest change detection with communication rate constraints is studied. A network of wireless sensors with limited computation capability monitors the environment and sends observations to a fusion center via wireless channels. At an unknown time instant, the distributions of observations at all the sensor nodes change simultaneously. Due to limited energy, the sensors cannot transmit at all the time instants. The objective is to detect the change at the fusion center as quickly as possible, subject to constraints on false detection and average communication rate between the sensors and the fusion center. A minimax formulation is proposed. The cumulative sum (CuSum) algorithm is used at the fusion center and censoring strategies are used at the sensor nodes. The censoring strategies, which are adaptive to the CuSum statistic, are fed back by the fusion center. The sensors only send observations that fall into prescribed sets to the fusion center. This CuSum adaptive censoring (CuSum-AC) algorithm is proved to be an equalizer rule and to be globally asymptotically optimal for any positive communication rate constraint, as the average run length to false alarm goes to infinity. It is also shown, by numerical examples, that the CuSum-AC algorithm provides a suitable trade-off between the detection performance and the communication rate.",1,Quickest Change Detection in Adaptive Censoring Sensor Networks
"In this paper, least square estimation (LSE)-based dynamic generator model parameter identification is investigated. Electromechanical dynamics related parameters such as inertia constant and primary frequency control droop for a synchronous generator are estimated using Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data obtained at the generator terminal bus. The key idea of applying LSE for dynamic parameter estimation is to have a discrete \underline{a}uto\underline{r}egression with e\underline{x}ogenous input (ARX) model. With an ARX model, a linear estimation problem can be formulated and the parameters of the ARX model can be found. This paper gives the detailed derivation of converting a generator model with primary frequency control into an ARX model.

Numerical results are presented to illustrate the proposed LSE application in dynamic system parameter identification using PMU data.",1,Least Squares Estimation-Based Synchronous Generator Parameter  Estimation Using PMU Data
"Unnecessary communication and computation in the periodic execution of control tasks lead to over-provisioning in hardware design (or underexploitation in hardware utilization) in control applications, such as networked control systems. To address these issues, researchers have proposed a new class of strategies, named event-driven strategies. Despite of their beneficiary effects, matters like task scheduling and appropriate dimensioning of communication components have become more complicated with respect to traditional periodic strategies. In this paper, we present a formal approach to derive an abstracted system that captures the sampling behavior of a family of event-triggered strategies for the case of LTI systems. This structure approximately simulates the sampling behavior of the aperiodic control system. Furthermore, the resulting quotient system is equivalent to a timed automaton. In the construction of the abstraction, the state space is confined to a finite number of convex regions, each of which represents a mode in the quotient system. An LMI-based technique is deployed to derive a sampling time interval associated to each region. Finally, reachability analysis is leveraged to find the transitions of the quotient system.",1,A Formal Traffic Characterization of LTI Event-triggered Control Systems
"For an uncontrollable system, adding leaders and adjusting edge weights are two methods to improve controllability. In this paper, controllability of multi-agent systems under directed topologies is studied, especially on leader selection problem and weight adjustment problem. For a given system, necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for controllability with fewest leaders are proposed. From another perspective, when leaders are fixed, controllability could be improved by adjusting edge weights, and therefore the system is supposed to be structurally controllable, which holds if and only if the communication topology contains a spanning tree. It is also proved that the number of fewest edges needed to be assigned on new weights equals the rank deficiency of controllability matrix. An algorithm on how to perform weight adjustment is presented. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.",1,Leader selection and weight adjustment problems for multi-agent systems
"We propose a new decentralized control scheme for DC Islanded microGrids (ImGs) composed by several Distributed Generation Units (DGUs) with a general interconnection topology. Each local controller regulates to a reference value the voltage of the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) of the corresponding DGU. Notably, off-line control design is conducted in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) fashion meaning that (i) the possibility of adding/removing a DGU without spoiling stability of the overall ImG is checked through an optimization problem; (ii) when a DGU is plugged in or out at most neighbouring DGUs have to update their controllers and (iii) the synthesis of a local controller uses only information on the corresponding DGU and lines connected to it. This guarantee total scalability of control synthesis as the ImG size grows or DGU gets replaced. Yes, under mild approximations of line dynamics, we formally guarantee stability of the overall closed-loop ImG. The performance of the proposed controllers is analyzed simulating different scenarios in PSCAD.",1,A decentralized scalable approach to voltage control of DC islanded  microgrids
"This paper considers the consensus problem for a network of nodes with random interactions and sampled-data control actions. We first show that consensus in expectation, in mean square, and almost surely are equivalent for a general random network model when the inter-sampling interval and network size satisfy a simple relation. The three types of consensus are shown to be simultaneously achieved over an independent or a Markovian random network defined on an underlying graph with a directed spanning tree. For both independent and Markovian random network models, necessary and sufficient conditions for mean-square consensus are derived in terms of the spectral radius of the corresponding state transition matrix. These conditions are then interpreted as the existence of critical value on the inter-sampling interval, below which global mean-square consensus is achieved and above which the system diverges in mean-square sense for some initial states. Finally, we establish an upper bound on the inter-sampling interval below which almost sure consensus is reached, and a lower bound on the inter-sampling interval above which almost sure divergence is reached. Some numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical results and some discussions on the critical value of the inter-sampling intervals for the mean-square consensus are provided.",1,Sampled-Data Consensus over Random Networks
"The optimal power-flow problem (OPF) has played a key role in the planning and operation of power systems. Due to the non-linear nature of the AC power-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard to solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that render the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently, Farivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial distribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show that it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of the physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines' current flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed relaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of specific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to account for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions. Recently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the use of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we show in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the non-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated, non-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the method of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is divided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM and ADMM to solve the OPF problem. In Part II, we provide a centralized version and a distributed asynchronous version of the proposed OPF algorithm and we evaluate its performances using both small-scale electrical networks, as well as a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder.",1,"AC OPF in Radial Distribution Networks - Parts I,II"

"In this paper, we address a collection of state space reachability problems, for linear time-invariant systems, using a minimal number of actuators. In particular, we design a zero-one diagonal input matrix B, with a minimal number of non-zero entries, so that a specified state vector is reachable from a given initial state. Moreover, we design a B so that a system can be steered either into a given subspace, or sufficiently close to a desired state. This work extends the recent results of Olshevsky and Pequito, where a zero-one diagonal or column matrix B is constructed so that the involved system is controllable. Specifically, we prove that the first two of our aforementioned problems are NP-hard; these results hold for a zero-one column matrix B as well. Then, we provide efficient polynomial time algorithms for their general solution, along with their worst case approximation guarantees. Finally, we illustrate their performance over large random networks.",1,Minimal Reachability Problems

A sensor node sends its local state estimate to a remote estimator over an unreliable wireless communication channel with random data packet drops. As related to packet dropout rate, transmission power is chosen by the sensor based on the relative importance of the local state estimate. The proposed power controller is proved to preserve Gaussianity of local estimate innovation, which enables us to obtain a closed-form solution of the expected state estimation error covariance. Comparisons with alternative non data-driven controllers demonstrate performance improvement using our approach.",1,Data-Driven Power Control for State Estimation: A Bayesian Inference  Approach
"Optimal control synthesis in stochastic systems with respect to quantitative temporal logic constraints can be formulated as linear programming problems. However, centralized synthesis algorithms do not scale to many practical systems. To tackle this issue, we propose a decomposition-based distributed synthesis algorithm. By decomposing a large-scale stochastic system modeled as a Markov decision process into a collection of interacting sub-systems, the original control problem is formulated as a linear programming problem with a sparse constraint matrix, which can be solved through distributed optimization methods. Additionally, we propose a decomposition algorithm which automatically exploits, if exists, the modular structure in a given large-scale system.

We propose a probabilistic method for synthesizing an optimal control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a specification based on a discrete approximation of the underlying stochastic system. First, we show that the original problem can be formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem in a state space augmented with finite memory and states of some clock variables. Second, we present a numerical method for computing an optimal policy with which the given specification is satisfied with the maximal probability in point-based semantics in the discrete approximation of the underlying system. We show that the policy obtained in the discrete approximation converges to the optimal one for satisfying the specification in the continuous or dense-time semantics as the discretization becomes finer in both state and time. Finally, we illustrate our approach with a robotic motion planning example.",1,Computational methods for stochastic control with metric interval  temporal logic specifications

"Recently, there has been immense interest in using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for civilian operations such as package delivery, firefighting, and fast disaster response. As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to support potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in order to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which these requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for meeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is only tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is unrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a single-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes corresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed maneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several liveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller, also based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers. For a single altitude range, our approach guarantees safety for one safety breach; in the unlikely event of multiple safety breaches, safety can be guaranteed over multiple altitude ranges.

A set of matrices {A,B_i} has been identified, via a linear matrix inequality, for which it is possible to ensure global tracking of (admissible, differentiable) trajectories with a simple linear time--varying PI controller. Instrumental to establish the result is the construction of an output signal with respect to which the incremental model is passive. The result is applied to the boost and the modular multilevel converter for which experimental results are given.",1,Global Tracking Passivity--based PI Control of Bilinear Systems and its  Application to the Boost and Modular Multilevel Converters
This letter proposes an analytical approach to formulate the power system oscillation frequency under a large disturbance. A fact is revealed that the oscillation frequency is only the function of the oscillation amplitude when the system's model and operating condition are fixed. Case studies also show that this function is damping-insensitive and could be applied to an inter-area model of a multi-machine power system.,1,An Analytical Formulation of Power System Oscillation Frequency
"A comprehensive review of the literature on manoeuvring target tracking for both uncluttered and cluttered measurements is presented. Various discrete-time dynamical models including non-random input, random-input and switching or hybrid system manoeuvre models are presented. The problem of manoeuvre detection is covered. Classical and current filtering methods for manoeuvre tracking are presented including multi-level process noise, input estimation, variable dimension filtering, two-stage filter, the interacting multiple model algorithm, and generalised pseudo-Bayesian algorithms. Various extensions of these algorithms to the case of cluttered measurements are also described and these include: joint manoeuvre and measurement association, probabilistic data association and multi-hypothesis tracking. Smoothing schemes, including IMM smoothing and batch expectation-maximisation using the Viterbi algorithm, are also described. The use of amplitude information for target measurement discrimination is discussed. It is noted that although many manoeuvre tacking techniques exist, the literature contains surprisingly few performance comparisons to guide the design engineer although a performance benchmark has recently been introduced.",1,A Survey of Manoeuvring Target Tracking Methods
"In this paper, a new polynomial chaos based framework for analyzing linear systems with probabilistic parameters is presented. Stability analysis and synthesis of optimal quadratically stabilizing controllers for such systems are presented as convex optimization problems, with exponential mean square stability guarantees. A Monte-Carlo approach for analysis and synthesis is also presented, which is used to benchmark the polynomial chaos based approach. The computational advantage of the polynomial chaos approach is shown with an example based on the design of an optimal EMS-stabilizing controller, for an F-16 aircraft model.",1,Robust State Feedback Control Design with Probabilistic System  Parameters
"Here we use polynomial chaos framework to design controllers for linear parameter varying (LPV) dynamical systems. We assume the scheduling variable to be random and use polynomial chaos approach to synthesize the controller for the resulting linear stochastic dynamical system. The stability of the LPV system is formulated as an exponential mean-square (EMS) stability problem. Two algorithms are presented that guarantee EMS stability of the stochastic system and correspond to parameter dependent and independent Lyapunov functions, respectively. LPV controllers from the polynomial chaos based framework is shown to outperform LPV controller from classical design for an example nonlinear system.",1,A Polynomial Chaos Framework for Designing Linear Parameter Varying  Control Systems
"A nonlinear frequency response based adaptive vibration controller is proposed for a class of nonlinear mechanical systems. In order to obtain the nonlinear Frequency Response Function (FRF), the convergence properties of the system are studied by using the convergence (contraction) theory. If the system under consideration is: 1) convergent, it directly enables to derive a nonlinear FRF for a band of excitation inputs, 2) non-convergent, first a controller is used to obtain the convergence and then the corresponding FRF for a band of excitation inputs is derived. Now the gains of the proposed adaptive controller are tuned such that a desired closed-loop frequency response, in the presence of excitation inputs is achieved. Finally, a building structure with nonlinear cubic stiffness and a satellite system are considered to illustrate the theoretical results.",1,Vibration Control Design for Nonlinear Systems using Frequency Response  Function
"An outage detection framework for power distribution networks is proposed. Given the tree structure of the distribution system, a method is developed combining the use of real-time power flow measurements on edges of the tree with load forecasts at the nodes of the tree. A maximum a posteriori detector {\color{black} (MAP)} is formulated for arbitrary number and location of outages on trees which is shown to have an efficient detector. A framework relying on the maximum missed detection probability is used for optimal sensor placement and is solved for tree networks. Finally, a set of case studies is considered using feeder data from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories. We show that a 10\% loss in mean detection reliability network wide reduces the required sensor density by 60 \% for a typical feeder if efficient use of measurements is performed.",1,Distribution System Outage Detection using Consumer Load and Line Flow  Measurements
"The present article introduces a reference framework for discussing resilience of computational systems. Rather than a property that may or may not be exhibited by a system, resilience is interpreted here as the emerging result of a dynamic process. Said process represents the dynamic interplay between the behaviors exercised by a system and those of the environment it is set to operate in. As a result of this interpretation, coherent definitions of several aspects of resilience can be derived and proposed, including elasticity, change tolerance, and antifragility. Definitions are also provided for measures of the risk of unresilience as well as for the optimal match of a given resilient design with respect to the current environmental conditions. Finally, a resilience strategy based on our model is exemplified through a simple scenario.",1,On Resilient Behaviors in Computational Systems and Environments
"This paper studies the distributed control and estimation of multi-agent systems based on bearing information. In particular, we consider two problems: (i) the distributed control of bearing-constrained formations using relative position measurements and (ii) the distributed localization of sensor networks using bearing measurements. Both of the two problems are considered in arbitrary dimensional spaces. The analyses of the two problems rely on the recently developed bearing rigidity theory. We show that the two problems have the same mathematical formulation and can be solved by identical protocols. The proposed controller and estimator can globally solve the two problems without ambiguity. The results are supported with illustrative simulations.",1,Bearing-Based Distributed Control and Estimation of Multi-Agent Systems
"This paper presents a general form of integral sliding mode manifold, and proposes an algorithmic approach based on Sum of Squares (SOS) programming to design generalized integral sliding mode manifold and controller for nonlinear systems with both matched and unmatched uncertainties. The approach also gives a sufficient condition for successful design of controller and manifold parameters. The result of the paper is then verified by several simulation examples and two practical applications, namely Glucose-insulin regulation problem and the unicycle dynamics steering problem are considered.",1,Generalized Integral Siding Mode Manifold Design: A Sum of Squares  Approach
"Two types of privacy-preserving decision making paradigms for utility-community interactions for multi-horizon operation are examined in this paper. In both designs, communities with renewable energy sources, distributed generators, and energy storage systems minimize their costs with limited information exchange with the utility. The utility makes decision based on the information provided from the communities. Through an iterative process, all parties achieve agreement. The authors' previous research results on subgradient and lower-upper-bound switching (LUBS)-based distributed optimization oriented multi-agent control strategies are examined and the convergence analysis of both strategies are provided. The corresponding decision making architectures, including information flow among agents and learning (or iteration) procedure, are developed for multi-horizon decision making scenarios. Numerical results illustrate the decision making procedures and demonstrate their feasibility of practical implementation. The two decision making architectures are compared for their implementation requirements as well as performance.",1,Dual Decomposition-Based Privacy-Preserving Multi-Horizon  Utility-Community Decision Making Paradigms
"The operation of groups of heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) at a small inter-vehicular distance (known as platoon) allows to lower the overall aerodynamic drag and, therefore, to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. However, due to the large mass and limited engine power of HDVs, slopes have a significant impact on the feasible and optimal speed profiles that each vehicle can and should follow. Therefore maintaining a short inter-vehicular distance as required by platooning without coordination between vehicles can often result in inefficient or even unfeasible trajectories. In this paper we propose a two-layer control architecture for HDV platooning aimed to safely and fuel-efficiently coordinate the vehicles in the platoon. Here, the layers are responsible for the inclusion of preview information on road topography and the real-time control of the vehicles, respectively. Within this architecture, dynamic programming is used to compute the fuel-optimal speed profile for the entire platoon and a distributed model predictive control framework is developed for the real-time control of the vehicles. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is analyzed by means of simulations of several realistic scenarios that suggest a possible fuel saving of up to 12% for the follower vehicles compared to the use of standard platoon controllers.",1,Cooperative look-ahead control for fuel-efficient and safe heavy-duty  vehicle platooning
"In this paper we address the problem of dynamic pricing for toll lanes on freeways. The proposed toll mechanism is broken up into two parts: (1) the supply side feedback control that computes the desired split ratios for the incoming traffic flows between the general purpose and the toll lanes; and (2) the demand side price setting algorithm that aims to enforce the computed split ratios.  The split ratio controller is designed and tested in the context of the link-node Cell Transmission Model with the modified node model of in/out flow distribution. The equilibrium structure of this traffic model is presented; and the case, in which the existence of a toll lane is meaningful, is discussed.  For the price setting, two alternative approaches are presented. The first one is commonly used, and it relies on the known Value of Time (VoT) distribution. Its shortcoming, however, is in the difficulty of the VoT distribution estimation. The second approach employs the auction mechanism, where travelers make bids on places in the toll lane. The advantage of this approach is that it enables direct control over how many vehicles will be allowed into the toll lane.",1,Modeling Toll Lanes and Dynamic Pricing Control
"This article addresses the residential energy cost optimization problem in smart grid. To date, most of the previous research only consider a partial aspect of the cost optimization problem. As a result, they fail to analyze scenarios when the interconnected components along with their properties have to be considered simultaneously. The proposed model combines these partial models into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to analyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it is useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart cities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g., the impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.). It allows energy trading in microgrid which introduces a cost fairness problem. It ensures Pareto optimality among the households which guarantees that no household will be worse off to improve the cost of others. Results show that it can maintain the user preferences and can react to a demand response program by rescheduling the household loads and sources. Finally, the paper addresses the challenge of the computational complexity of the proposed model, showing that solution time increases exponentially with the problem size and proposes possible approaches to solve this.",1,A Unified Residential Energy Cost Optimization Model for Smart Grid -  Significance and Challenge
"We introduce a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) framework for synthesizing continuous-time switching controllers that guarantee reach while stay (RWS) properties of the closed loop system. The solution is based on synthesizing specially defined class of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for switched systems, that yield switching controllers with a guaranteed minimum dwell time in each mode. Next, we use a CEGIS-based approach to iteratively solve the resulting quantified exists-forall constraints, and find a CLF. We introduce relaxations to guarantee termination, as well as heuristics to increase convergence speed. Finally, we evaluate our approach on a set of benchmarks ranging from two to six state variables. Our evaluation includes a preliminary comparison with related tools. The proposed approach shows the promise of nonlinear SMT solvers for the synthesis of provably correct switching control laws.",1,Counterexample Guided Synthesis of Switched Controllers for  Reach-While-Stay Properties
"In this paper, we consider the state controllability of networked systems, where the network topology is directed and weighted and the nodes are higher-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems. We investigate how the network topology, the node-system dynamics, the external control inputs, and the inner interactions affect the controllability of a networked system, and show that for a general networked multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) system: 1) the controllability of the overall network is an integrated result of the aforementioned relevant factors, which cannot be decoupled into the controllability of individual node-systems and the properties solely determined by the network topology, quite different from the familiar notion of consensus or formation controllability; 2) if the network topology is uncontrollable by external inputs, then the networked system with identical nodes will be uncontrollable, even if it is structurally controllable; 3) with a controllable network topology, controllability and observability of the nodes together are necessary for the controllability of the networked systems under some mild conditions, but nevertheless they are not sufficient. For a networked system with single-input/single-output (SISO) LTI nodes, we present precise necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability of a general network topology.",1,Controllability of networked MIMO systems
"One of the major problems in adaptive filtering is the problem of system identification. It has been studied extensively due to its immense practical importance in a variety of fields. The underlying goal is to identify the impulse response of an unknown system. This is accomplished by placing a known system in parallel and feeding both systems with the same input. Due to initial disparity in their impulse responses, an error is generated between their outputs. This error is set to tune the impulse response of known system in a way that every change in impulse response reduces the magnitude of prospective error. This process is repeated until the error becomes negligible and the responses of both systems match. To specifically minimize the error, numerous adaptive algorithms are available. They are noteworthy either for their low computational complexity or high convergence speed. Recently, a method, known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), has gained much attention due to its remarkably low computational complexity. But despite this colossal advantage, properties of MCMC method have not been investigated for adaptive system identification problem. This article bridges this gap by providing a complete treatment of MCMC method in the aforementioned context.",1,Adaptive System Identification using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
"We propose a systematic method to directly identify a sensor fault estimation filter from plant input/output data collected under fault-free condition. This problem is challenging, especially when omitting the step of building an explicit state-space plant model in data-driven design, because the inverse of the underlying plant dynamics is required and needs to be stable. We show that it is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based fault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov parameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by avoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from identification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter. Furthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained filter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based system inversion. This crucial property enables its application to sensor faults in unstable plants, where existing data-driven filter designs could not be applied so far due to the lack of such stability guarantees (even after stabilizing the closed-loop system). A numerical simulation example of sensor faults in an unstable aircraft system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed new method.",1,Direct identification of fault estimation filter for sensor faults
"In this paper, a novel sensor fault detection, isolation and identification (FDII) strategy is proposed by using the multiple model (MM) approach. The scheme is based on multiple hybrid Kalman filters (HKF) which represents an integration of a nonlinear mathematical model of the system with a number of piecewise linear (PWL) models. The proposed fault detection and isolation (FDI) scheme is capable of detecting and isolating sensor faults during the entire operational regime of the system by interpolating the PWL models using a Bayesian approach. Moreover, the proposed multiple HKF-based FDI scheme is extended to identify the magnitude of a sensor fault by using a modified generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) method which relies on the healthy operational mode of the system. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposed FDII methodology, extensive simulation studies are conducted for a nonlinear gas turbine engine. Various single and concurrent sensor fault scenarios are considered to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed on-line hierarchical multiple HKF-based FDII scheme under different flight modes. Finally, our proposed HKF-based FDI approach is compared with various filtering methods such as the linear, extended, unscented and cubature Kalman filters (LKF, EKF, UKF and CKF, respectively) corresponding to both interacting and non-interacting multiple model (MM) based schemes. Our comparative studies confirm the superiority of our proposed HKF method in terms of promptness of the fault detection, lower false alarm rates, as well as robustness with respect to the engine health parameters degradations.",1,"Sensor Fault Detection, Isolation and Identification Using Multiple  Model-based Hybrid Kalman Filter for Gas Turbine Engines"
"Storage-concerned economic dispatch (ED) problems with complementarity constraints are strongly non-convex and hard to solve because traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions do not hold in this condition. In our recent paper, we proposed a new exact relaxation method which directly removes the complementarity constraints from the model to make it convex and easier to solve. This paper further extends our previous study, with more than one group of sufficient conditions that guarantee the exact relaxation presented, proven and discussed. This paper may contribute to wider application of the exact relaxation in storage-concerned ED problems.",1,Further Discussions on Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of  Complementarity Constraints for Storage-Concerned Economic Dispatch

"In this paper we show how to split the Root Locus plot for an irreducible rational transfer function into several individual algebraic plane curves, like lines, circles, conics, etc. To achieve this goal we use results of a previous paper of the author to represent the Root Locus as an algebraic variety generated by an ideal over a polynomial ring, and whose primary decomposion allow us to isolate the planes curves that composes the Root Locus. As a by-product, using the concept of duality in projective algebraic geometry, we show how to obtain the dual curve of each plane curve that composes the Root Locus and unite them to obtain what we denominate the Algebraic Dual Root Locus.",1,Splitting Root-Locus Plot into Algebraic Plane Curves
"An algebraic expression for the Preisach hysteron, which is a non-ideal (delayed) relay operator, is formulated for a computationally efficient real-time implementation. This allows representing the classical scalar Preisach hysteresis model as a summation of a large number of weighted hysterons which computation can be accomplished in parallel. The latter makes possible an efficient FPGA or ASIC realization of the scalar Preisach hysteresis model that can be useful for multiple applications. The signal flow which specifies the model implementation is provided in form of the block diagram. The proposed computation of Preisach hysterons, aggregated to the entire Preisach hysteresis model, is evaluated numerically and on a real-time hardware platform.",1,Computationally efficient formulation of relay operator for Preisach  hysteresis modeling
"In actual implementations of magnetic control laws for spacecraft attitude stabilization, the time in which Earth magnetic field is measured must be separated from the time in which magnetic dipole moment is generated. The latter separation translates into the constraint of being able to genere only piecewise-constant magnetic dipole moment. In this work we present attitude stabilization laws using only magnetic actuators that take into account of the latter aspect. Both a state feedback and an output feedback are presented, and it is shown that the proposed design allows for a systematic selection of the sampling period.",1,Spacecraft Attitude Stabilization with Piecewise-constant Magnetic  Dipole Moment
"The phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem is revisited by taking into account a stronger characterization of the electrical connectedness between various buses in the grid. To facilitate this study, the placement problem is approached from the perspective of the \emph{electrical structure} which, unlike previous work on PMU placement, accounts for the sensitivity between power injections and nodal phase angle differences between various buses in the power network. The problem is formulated as a binary integer program with the objective to minimize the number of PMUs for complete network observability in the absence of zero injection measurements. The implication of the proposed approach on static state estimation and fault detection algorithms incorporating PMU measurements is analyzed. Results show a significant improvement in the performance of estimation and detection schemes by employing the electrical structure-based PMU placement compared to its topological counterpart. In light of recent advances in the electrical structure of the grid, our study provides a more realistic perspective of PMU placement in the electric power grid.",1,An Electrical Structure-Based Approach to PMU Placement in the Electric  Power Grid
"Future power grids will offer enhanced controllability due to the increased availability of power flow control units (FACTS). As the installation of control units in the grid is an expensive investment, we are interested in using few controllers to achieve high controllability. In particular, two questions arise: How many flow control buses are necessary to obtain globally optimal power flows? And if fewer flow control buses are available, what can we achieve with them? Using steady state IEEE benchmark data sets, we explore experimentally that already a small number of controllers placed at certain grid buses suffices to achieve globally optimal power flows. We present a graph-theoretic explanation for this behavior. To answer the second question we perform a set of experiments that explore the existence and costs of feasible power flow solutions at increased loads with respect to the number of flow control buses in the grid. We observe that adding a small number of flow control buses reduces the flow costs and extends the existence of feasible solutions at increased load.",1,Operating Power Grids with Few Flow Control Buses
